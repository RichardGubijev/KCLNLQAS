What are the disputes about? The national disputes are in relation to pensions, pay and working conditions. King's is one of 150 universities across the UK impacted by the disputes. What is King's doing about the issues that have contributed to industrial action? We recognise the important issues which are of concern to our students and staff, and colleagues across the higher education sector, which have contributed to the industrial action. You can read more about what King\u2019s is doing here. When will industrial action take place? There are currently no mandates for industrial action in place at King's. If a trade union secures a mandate for industrial action in the future, you will be notified of any planned strike days or periods of action short of a strike (ASOS). Exams, assessments and progression Please read our article How might industrial action affect my exams, assessments and progression through my studies? for more information. General questions What is industrial action? Industrial action is the general term for collective legal actions taken by employees of a company or organisation as a protest. It can consist of both strike action and action short of a strike (ASOS). What is strike action? Strike action is a form of industrial action where some workers collectively withdraw their labour on specific days. The trade union will notify the university of strike days at least two weeks in advance. However, individual staff members are not legally required to notify the university of their intention to strike on these defined days. What is action short of strike (ASOS)? Action short of a strike (ASOS) is when staff take other action such as limiting some of their work-related activities outside of any strike days. ASOS is determined by the union and can run simultaneously to strike days and continue until the union calls it off. During previous industrial action, ASOS has consisted of staff members working their contracted hours and duties and not volunteering to do more, not rescheduling classes and lectures cancelled due to strike action, not covering for absent colleagues, removing uploaded materials related to, and/or not sharing materials related to lectures or classes that were cancelled because of strike action. How could industrial action affect me? In the event of future industrial action, the university would remain open, and we would do everything we could to ensure you continued to have access to the facilities and services on campus including informal study spaces, libraries and computer rooms. There might be some changes to opening and closing times of some of our buildings and some entrances and exits might not be in use. Signs would be in place to direct you to alternative entrances and exits. Some of the opening times for libraries might change; this would be shown on the\u00a0libraries website. Our\u00a0student advice, wellbeing and welfare services\u00a0would continue to be available throughout industrial action. If I were to feel worried about crossing a picket line, what would I do? On strike days, you might see a group of people at our campus entrances who are supporting the strike action - this is a picket line. This is a normal activity during strike action and you would still be able to access the building. Our security staff would be on hand to help anyone that would like assistance to enter the building. If you couldn't easily find a member of the security team, you would be able to contact them by calling +44 (0)207 8482222. How could industrial action affect research? We wouldn't expect industrial action to have any significant effects on research. In the event of industrial action, please continue with your research, as guided by your supervisor(s). We would expect related training courses and workshops to continue as normal, so you should attend unless you are advised otherwise by the relevant department or training provider. If you are a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA), please see the staff Q&A. Teaching and\u00a0learning Would teaching and learning go ahead on strike days? Some staff might choose to strike but many other staff would be working on these days. In the event of industrial action, you should attend unless your lecturer or department tell you otherwise. Should I attend supervision of projects and dissertations? In the event of industrial action, you should continue to attend unless your lecturer or department tell you otherwise. Should I submit assignments? Yes, you should continue to submit your assignments to the existing deadline in the event of industrial action. You would be notified if there were any change in the submission arrangements. You would not need to apply for mitigating circumstances if the department adjusted assignment deadlines as a consequence of industrial action. Would any sessions be cancelled? In the event of industrial action, there might be instances where sessions would have to be cancelled. If they can, your faculty or department would let you know as soon as possible of any change to your timetabled session. We would ask you to please continue to check your emails and KEATS regularly. However, we would not always be able to inform you of any changes in advance, as staff members would not legally be required to tell the university if they planned to take industrial action. Important to know: If a staff member were to\u00a0not arrive for the start of a teaching session, you should wait a few minutes to make sure your lecturer is not late before leaving the room.If a lecture, tutorial or other planned contact point were\u00a0cancelled due to industrial action, you should\u00a0make a note of it. Would any sessions be rescheduled? In the event of industrial action, there might be instances where sessions would have to be rescheduled. If your lecture or class were affected by strike action but still took place, you would be expected to attend at the rescheduled time unless you had been given prior permission to be absent in line with normal procedure. Would I still be able to access\u00a0campus during industrial action? Yes, the university would remain open, and we would do everything we could to ensure you continued to have access to the facilities and services on campus including informal study spaces, libraries and computer rooms. We would support you with your studies and independent learning. Our\u00a0student advice, wellbeing and welfare services\u00a0would continue to be available to you throughout industrial action.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b I\u2019m a King\u2019s Online student, how might industrial action affect me? You might still experience some disruption on strike days, including cancellation of live teaching events and facilitated webinars, or reduced moderation in discussion forums. Your Student Success Advisor would remain available throughout the period of industrial action and would continue to be your first point of contact for all matters related to your programme. International students How would the industrial action affect my visa in terms of my attendance record? Your Student visa conditions would not be affected by the industrial action. You should attend as scheduled, and the normal processes for attendance monitoring would apply to undisrupted sessions. I'm a visiting study abroad or exchange student, how might industrial action affect me? You might still experience some disruption due to strike action and action short of a strike (ASOS), in the same way as other students.\u202fThe Global Mobility team would remain available throughout the period of industrial action and would be able to provide additional support and guidance. Support Would I still be able to get access to student services? Student services would remain available throughout any industrial action period. More information about the range of support services available can be found in this article. You would also be able to access impartial and confidential academic advice support services from KCLSU. More information is available on the\u00a0KCLSU website.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b What additional support would be available for my personal and professional development? King\u2019s Edge is a programme of extracurricular initiatives and events available to all students, including internships and volunteering opportunities, language courses, community organising and much more. It would continue to be available throughout industrial action.

Where would I be able to go for support? We understand that industrial action might cause additional stress and pressure on top of your studies.

For more information, including our King's Counselling Online service, please visit our article on Mental health support during evenings, weekends & vacation periods. Important to know: The services listed above would not be able to answer questions about the industrial action. Would I need to submit a Mitigating Circumstances Form for teaching cancelled due to industrial action? No, it is not expected that you would need to submit a Mitigating Circumstances Form (MCF) due to strike action, as your department would put in place measures to provide mitigation for all students in this situation. However, there might be very limited exceptional circumstances in which you might feel that you have been more severely impacted due to your personal circumstances, and that industrial action has unduly affected your assessments. In that case, you would contact your department in the first instance, who would be able to provide more information on what steps were taken and would let you know if they thought that you had exceptional circumstances, where an MCF might be appropriate. If an MCF were deemed appropriate, your department would support you to complete it. Complaints Will there be compensation for previous industrial action? When industrial action takes place, not all programmes are impacted because not all staff take part; any potential impact is variable and specific. As a result, the university does not make any general changes to tuition fees due to industrial action. If you feel that your education has been impacted by industrial action, you have the right to complain through a\u00a0formal process. Complaints are always considered on their own merits, on a case-by-case basis, and outcomes are specific to individual circumstances. This includes consideration of the ways in which mitigation has been applied for any teaching that hasn't taken place. Can I complain about disruption due to industrial action? Yes, there is a specific process and complaint form for raising a complaint in relation to industrial action. Details are available in the article\u00a0How can I make a complaint to the university?\u00a0including timeframes for submitting your complaint. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bImportant to know:\u00a0Faculties and departments are unable to deal with any complaints, and these should be directed through the process outlined in the article above.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Further questions Who can I send questions to? If you have any questions or concerns that are not answered here, please contact us by submitting an enquiry through our\u00a0online enquiry form. When asked what your enquiry is about, please select \u2018industrial action\u2019,\u00a0to help us get your question to the right team. You can also contact your faculty or department if you have questions about your programme.

King\u2019s is a member of the Hidden Disabilities Sunflower network. The Sunflower helps members of our community who have invisible disabilities to access the support they need. Wearing the Sunflower lets people know that you have a non-visible disability and might need extra help, understanding or time. Whether or not you choose to wear the Sunflower is completely up to you. The aim of the Sunflower is to raise awareness of invisible disabilities, helping to ensure our community is inclusive and welcoming. Where can I learn more about hidden disabilities and the Sunflower? Everyone has a part to play in making King\u2019s a safe place for those with hidden disabilities. You can help by taking our Hidden Disability Sunflower Awareness Training. You\u2019ll get a certificate once you complete the course. The course explains: What a hidden disability is\u00a0What the Hidden Disability Sunflower is\u00a0What to do if you see someone wearing a Sunflower at King's Important to know: You\u2019ll be asked to give your name at the start of the training. This helps us to keep track of how many people have completed it. Where can I get a Sunflower? Sunflower lanyards are free and available to all King's students via our main reception desks and Disability Support & Inclusion drop-ins. If you ask for one, the member of staff on duty should hand you one with no further questions. Please visit the following locations to collect your Sunflower lanyard: Denmark Hill Campus: WEC & IoPPN receptions Strand Campus: Bush House SE Wing & Strand Building receptions St Thomas' Campus: Gate 3 Security Guy's Campus: Hodgkin's Building reception Waterloo Campus: Franklin Wilkins Building I'd prefer to collect a Sunflower lanyard in private, which Disabilty Support & Inclusion drop-ins offer them? Our Assistant Disabilty Advisors offer 15-minute drop-in appointments during term time. You can use these meetings to ask for Sunflower lanyard and discuss any other concerns or queries you may have. For information about when and where the drop-ins take place, please read our article How can I contact the Disability Support & Inclusion team?\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b What should I do if I see someone wearing a Sunflower lanyard? In addition to completing the Hidden Disabilities Sunflower Training, you may find the following tips helpful. Do: Recontextualise someone's needs or behaviours once you're aware of their hidden disability or condition Be friendly and respectful Be prepared to offer assistance, compassion and extra time if needed Keep an eye out if the person looks like they may need assistance Check how you can help rather than assuming a person's needs, for example by asking, \u2018Is there anything I can do to help?\u2019 Do not: Loudly call out to people or make a big fuss Interrupt wearers to check in on them when they are clearly getting on with something Speak to the wearer's assistant rather than to them Expect all wearers to have the same needs Invade someone's personal space Make a big fuss in public places Reduce your expectations of someone's ability to achieve Ask invasive questions about someone's condition Assume that all students with hidden disabilities will choose to wear a lanyard Can I wear the Sunflower lanyard instead of my King\u2019s lanyard? You should always wear your red King's lanyard when you're on campus. However, you can wear your Sunflower lanyard as well at any time. We\u2019ve decided to keep these as two separate lanyards so that it\u2019s easy for wearers to choose when they want to wear their Sunflower lanyard. Can I use my Sunflower lanyard outside King\u2019s? The lanyards are recognised in many spaces outside of King's so please use them whenever is most helpful to you. You can discover Sunflower friendly locations near to you at the Hidden Disabilities Sunflower website. Can I have an individualised card to put in my lanyard? You can purchase an individualised card from the Hidden Disabilities Sunflower shop.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Keywords: disability; hidden; sunflower Related Articles (3) Am I disabled?

Remember to claim everything that you are entitled to and seek guidance when needed. Here are our suggestions for more sustainable living: 1. BYOB\u2026 Be your own barista! Whether it\u2019s for that 09:00 lecture or that you are simply not yourself until you\u2019ve had your first sip of coffee for the day, coffee can be lovely. But,\u00a0do you know that Londoners spend a staggering average of \u00a32200 a year in high-street coffee shops? It\u2019s worth re-thinking your choices and consider the money you save\u2026 Paper cups with plastic lids are also very bad for the environment. Although they are made largely of paper, disposable coffee cups are lined with plastic polyethylene to make the cups waterproof to contain liquid. This means cups cannot be recycled at standard recycling plants and 99% end up unrecycled. Unrecycled plastic takes hundreds of years to break down. Alternatives: Consider buying your own coffee machine. You may even consider sharing the price with flatmates/housemates if they are coffee lovers as well. There are lots of varieties to choose from, across of price points. From pod-coffee machines to a French press, there\u2019s something for everyone. You also want to consider getting a King\u2019s College London KeepCup which are available from all the university restaurants and cafes. This is then both a souvenir and a sustainable, cost-effective and environmentally friendly way to drink coffee. 2. Waste not, want not Fun fact: Food and drink that could have been eaten but was sent to the landfill in 2015 would fill up 9 Wembley Stadiums, 40 million wheelie bins, 4000 Olympic sized swimming pools\u2026In numbers, this costs every average UK household a staggering \u00a3700! This is obviously unhealthy for both the environment and your bank account. So here are some tips to help you make small changes to a more sustainable and cost-effective living. Stale baked goods such as bread can often be revitalised with a quick blast in the oven. Or; prevent them becoming stale in the first place by freezing some of it\u00a0on the day of purchase. The taste and quality will remain the same once defrosted. Plan to eat leftovers on a regular night each week. Check out bargain websites selling food, groceries and other products that are approaching best before dates at websites like CheapFood and ClearanceXL.Try food sharing \u2013 pick up good food from restaurants for free at Olio.Stay up-to-date with awesome tips on sustainable living at Treehugger. You can visit BBC good food for more tips on how to reduce food waste. 3. Swap & share What if it was possible to shop for free? If you want a wardrobe refresh without spending a fortune, or if you have clothing that you no longer wear but are still good, try swapping and sharing them with friends on your course, or at your residence. Better yet, get involved in the clothing swaps taking place all over London. To find upcoming events visit Eventbrite \u2013 clothes swap. 4. Pre-loved selling and shopping Consider buying pre-loved items from boot sales and charity shops like Crisis and 10 of London\u2019s Best Car Boot Sales.Don't have time to walk round the shops? There are lots of online platforms you can try to not only buy but also sell off your old electronics, books, clothing, and many other items. Not only can you convert into cash things that are no longer useful to you, you\u2019ll also be doing someone else a favour by giving them what they are looking for. Websites to try are: WebuyVintedEbayDepopShpock Important to know: Be aware of scams. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Make sure you\u2019re dealing with a genuine buyer/seller before parting with your cash or product, and always report negative experiences. Depending on the site, you might be able to check the seller's/buyer's feedback score and rating, and see comments about experience of the product or seller/buyer. 5. The great outdoors When the weather, time (and energy) permits, take some time to get outdoors - it\u2019s good for you and the environment. Spending time outside is energy efficient, you can save money and support the environment by walking to your local park instead of using transport.

Extra tips for student parents and carers Maternity and baby clothes, and toys are expensive and only needed for such a short period of time so where possible borrow/share from friends or relatives. Buying clothes and toys: If you don\u2019t have people around you with children, have a look at our suggestions for buying, swapping and sharing above, but also look out for local/community Facebook groups, which have the potential for lots of swapping/sharing opportunities. Look out for Mummy\u2019s Gin Fund and local NCT groups.

If you are a first-year undergraduate student (including integrated master's programmes) and you don't pass all of your modules, you may be eligible for some credit to be 'compensated' to allow you to progress to the next year of study. Compensated credit is not always available and there are a number of eligibility criteria.\u00a0More information can be found in Chapter 5 of the Academic Manual. Non-core first-year undergraduate modules worth up to 30 credits may be compensated if you have met both of these conditions: Achieved a pass mark in all core modules and in a minimum of 90 credits overallAttempted the assessments for all modules, taking into consideration the outcome of any mitigating circumstances request Important to know: Students in the Faculty of Natural, Mathematical and Engineering Sciences must also achieve a module mark of least 30 in another non-core subject module to be eligible for compensation. Compensation allowance There is a compensation allowance for different programme types. For the relevant guidance on compensation allowance for each programme, please read our breakdown of the information, by programme type. 3-year and 4-year honours For the programmes listed below, non-core modules worth up to 30 credits may be compensated in year 1. Bachelor of Arts (BA)Bachelor of Engineering (BEng)Bachelor of Laws (LLB)Bachelor of Music (BMus)Bachelor of Science (BSc), excluding\u00a0the Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery\u00a0& Palliative CareBachelor of Science (Engineering)\u00a0(BSc (Eng)) \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b For the programmes listed below, non-core modules worth up\u00a0to 15 credits\u00a0may be compensated\u00a0in Year 1.

Any module code not followed by any brackets indicates that it is non-core. Grades of AB and D indicate the assessment has not been attempted. Examples of compensation In our image showing an example below, you can see that 4AAH0002 is a non-core module that has a mark of 0 and a grade of AB, meaning that the assessment has not been attempted. Example: As there is one more attempt left in the module, the module is not compensable and the re-assessment must be attempted, otherwise this may lead to an academic failure and removal from the programme. In our image showing another example below, if the re-assessment is attempted and failed in 4AAH0002, then the compensation will be applied as this is a non-core module.

UKVI policy states that universities must determine a student\u2019s right to study before they can be fully enrolled at their institution. This means that if you don\u2019t hold a British or Irish passport, you must provide evidence of your current immigration permission to be in the UK. Important to know: This includes students who are here as a visitor for a short amount of time for a short course, or students that hold indefinite leave to remain and settlement status. We can\u2019t fully enrol a student until we\u2019ve assessed their right to study. It should normally take 5-10 minutes for you to complete this task online and up to 3 working days for your check to be reviewed. How to complete the Right to Study check To access the task, you can click on the link that will be sent to your King\u2019s email address once you've completed stage 1 of the enrolment process. You can also\u00a0log in to Student Records directly using your K number and password\u00a0(these are included in the welcome email sent to your personal email address).\u00a0Once you've logged in to Student Records, click the button at the bottom of the page which says Click here to start your Right to Study Check.\u00a0After you complete the task, a member of the Visa Compliance team will check your documents.

After you've received this, you'll then be able to arrange your student ID collection.\u00a0If we need more information, a member of the Visa Compliance team will contact you with more details. Can I complete the Right to Study task outside of the UK? The Right to Study task can only be successfully completed once you\u2019ve arrived in the UK. This is because we need to see evidence of when you arrived in the UK.If you select in the task that you\u2019re outside of the UK, it\u2019ll ask you to provide a UK arrival date. The task will relaunch to you on the date that you enter the UK.Important to know: You can\u2019t enter the current date or a date in the past. It must be a date in the future.You\u2019ll then be able to complete the task once you\u2019re inside the UK with the relevant documents, including proof of entry to the UK. What if I can't find or access the task? There are several reasons why you may not be able to find the task.\u00a0This could be due to one of the following reasons: If you're a British/Irish national (passport holder) or a distance learner, you're not required to complete the RTS check. You'll be able to go straight to the final\u00a0stage of enrolment to collect your ID card.You've not completed\u00a0online enrolment.\u00a0The RTS task will only be launched to you once you've completed online enrolment, which is Stage 1 of the enrolment process.You've started the RTS task from outside of the UK and selected a future arrival date.

When will my results be available? Exam and assessment results, module results and final degree classifications will be made available on Student Records as soon as possible after your assessment board has met to finalise and ratify results. Results are typically released in the following months: For Period 1 (January) assessments:\u00a0March-AprilFor Period 2 (May) assessments:\u00a0July\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bFor Period 3 (August) assessments:\u00a0September Additional information for postgraduate taught students Most postgraduate\u00a0taught (PGT) courses run from September to September. As such, the assessment boards for these courses meet between October and December, after the official end date of the course. Some departments will release some module results before the official end of your course, and some departments will wait until after your course end date. In all cases, you should not expect to receive your degree award until after the official end of your course. How will I be told my results are available? When your results are available, you'll be sent an email with instructions, which also provides\u00a0information on your progression from one year of study to the next or your final degree award. How can I view my results? You can view your results by logging into\u00a0Student Records. Once you have logged in, you'll see a 'My Modules' container on the homepage. This is where you can view your module results. If you have also obtained your final award, you can view this in the My Award container, under View Final Result. Reviewing your results In the table you can see your module, assessments and results. If your programme has any core modules, these will be shown in brackets after the module code. How can I view my exam scripts? As a student, you're entitled to view your marked exam scripts - this information can support your learning and help you to understand the mark you received. Faculties and departments are required to make exam scripts available to you, free of charge, after provisional results have been published. When you make a request to view your exam scripts via your faculty/department, they will either: Provide\u00a0a photocopy of the exam script and let you know once it\u2019s available to collect, or\u00a0Provide\u00a0a scanned copy which will be sent to your King\u2019s email address, or\u00a0Provide\u00a0a timeslot for you to come to campus to view your script. Faculties are required to arrange access to a copy of your exam script within 10 working days of receiving the request (excluding university closure periods). Exam scripts won\u2019t necessarily contain detailed commentary. If you wish to discuss your exam script, you can make an appointment with your personal tutor or subject tutor. Important to know: You'll\u00a0be provided with copies only, not the original exam scripts.You're\u00a0not entitled to copies of exam question papers.Multiple\u00a0choice question exams (MCQs), objective structured clinical exams (OSCEs) and short answer question exams (SAQs) are all exempt from this process. If\u00a0you have any questions about accessing your exam scripts, please get in touch with your faculty or department. Can I resit an exam or retake an assessment? Depending on your programme of study, you may be given an opportunity to resit an exam during a future assessment period\u00a0if you have failed a module (i.e., you have an overall module mark below the pass mark) due to the following: Not meeting the academic requirementsSubmitting late or not submitting/not taking an online exam If you are\u00a0given an opportunity to resit,\u00a0your module mark will be capped at the pass mark.\u00a0You\u00a0will normally be reassessed in the failed elements of assessment, and by the same methods as your\u00a0first attempt. Important to know: Please speak to staff in your faculty or department\u00a0to understand the\u00a0specific rules about retaking assessments for your modules and/or programme. Your course handbook may also include helpful guidance on resits. I\u2019m unable to resit my exam due to mitigating circumstances\u200b\u200b We know that there are times when unexpected circumstances occur, such as an illness, bereavement, or difficult family circumstances, which can affect your ability to study or complete an assessment. We call situations like these 'mitigating circumstances'. A mitigating circumstance might: Affect your ability to study for, prepare and submit an assessed piece of work by a set deadline.Affect your ability to attend an exam, class or lab assessment on a date set by your department. How do I apply for mitigating circumstances? Please read our article How to apply for mitigating circumstances\u00a0for further information. Who can I talk to if I need further academic support? Your\u00a0personal tutor\u00a0can provide general guidance on academic practice and can help you understand feedback that you have received across your modules. They will also encourage you to seek further specialist support with study skills if needed.

There are currently no mandates for industrial action in place at King's. In this article you will find information in relation to the following, if industrial action were to occur again in the future: Students or\u00a0graduates affected by the 2023 marking and assessment boycottMarking and resultsProgression and\u00a0graduationTaking exams and assessments This article was last updated on 5 April 2024. Students or graduates affected by the 2023 marking and assessment boycott I\u2019ve graduated, but some of my work wasn\u2019t marked by the module leader due to the 2023 marking and assessment boycott - will it be remarked? No, assessments which have already been marked, where your overall results and final degree classification were ratified, will not be re-marked. If you were made aware that your module was affected by the 2023 marking and assessment boycott but your assessment was marked while the boycott was still active, please be assured that this will mean that another appropriately qualified subject matter expert marked your assessment, in line with the affected assessment\u2019s marking scheme. To assure and monitor the quality of the education we provide to you and ensure that marking and assessment reflects your academic achievements and success in meeting programme learning outcomes, this marking by other qualified subject matter experts would have been overseen by senior academics in the faculty. I\u2019ve graduated, but some of my work wasn\u2019t marked due to the 2023 marking and assessment boycott and I had assessments re-weighted or I was granted condoned credit instead - will it be marked? No, assessments which were not marked, where your overall results and final degree classification were ratified, will not now be marked. For more information on re-weighting and awarding of condoned credit due to the marking and assessment boycott, please see the questions below. I've graduated, and my results show I have 'condoned credit' due to the 2023 marking and assessment boycott, what does this mean? King\u2019s regulations allow the classification and award of a degree when there are a small number of modules where marks are unavailable. This is only to a maximum of 30 credits (out of the 360 credits that you typically study on a 3-year programme) and can only apply to non-core modules and where the work has been completed and submitted satisfactorily. Where condoned credit was granted as a result of the 2023 marking and assessment boycott, King's assured itself that the learning outcomes for the programme had been met and that the overall average mark reflected your academic achievement. The credits were awarded to you on the basis of your performance in all other modules. Although you were awarded the credit, those credits were not counted in the calculation of the overall average. The fact that your results show \"zero\" for a particular module would not have reduced your average mark. This has the same effect as applying the average of your performance in all other modules to those with missing marks. Your final transcript and Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR) will show where you were awarded condoned credit due to the boycott. You can download these documents through Gradintelligence, as well as an additional accompanying letter to help explain the situation to\u00a0potential employers or other universities.\u00a0Please see this article for further information on how to do this. I've graduated, and my results previously showed I had a 'condoned fail' due to the 2023 marking and assessment boycott, has this now been updated? Yes, we have changed 'condoned fail' to 'condoned credit' wherever this terminology appeared on your final transcript or Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR), if you were awarded condoned credit due to the 2023 marking and assessment boycott. 'Condoned fail' previously appeared automatically due to technical limitations; we understand this may have caused confusion and concern, since students awarded condoned credit due to the boycott did not 'fail' as such, for which we apologise. If you were affected by this, you can download your updated HEAR and final transcript through Gradintelligence. Please see this article for further information on how to do this. You'll also find an additional accompanying letter on Gradintelligence, which you can provide to\u00a0potential employers or other universities to explain the condoned credit that appears on your documents. I've graduated, and my prospective employer is concerned about the impacts of the 2023 marking and assessment boycott, what should I tell them? King's has extensive regulations in place to assure and monitor the quality of the education we provide and ensure that marking and assessment reflects academic achievements and success in meeting programme learning outcomes, including in the event of industrial action. This includes ensuring that work is marked and assessed by subject matter experts. If you are applying for a job and your prospective employer has concerns, you may wish to refer them to these FAQs. For more information on support available to you, please see our article How can King's Careers & Employability help me? If you were awarded condoned credit due to the boycott, this will be indicated on your final transcript and Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR).\u00a0You can download these documents through Gradintelligence, as well as an additional accompanying letter to help explain the situation to\u00a0potential employers or other universities.\u00a0Please see this article for further information on how to do this. My results show an assessment was 're-weighted' due to the 2023 marking and assessment boycott, what does this mean?\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Adjustments to the weighting of assessments (for example, changing an assessment from a weighting of 75% to 100% of the overall module mark) were used only for a very limited number of modules where one or more of the students' marks were missing. Any changes to the weighting of assessments were applied only once it was assured that learning outcomes were still being met and that they appropriately reflect your academic achievement. Adjustments were scrutinised and overseen by King's via the Academic Standards Sub-Committee (ASSC) and applied to the cohort. All individual cases were carefully considered to ensure consistency and fairness to our students.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Can I make a complaint in relation to the 2023 marking and assessment boycott? Full information on how to make a complaint in relation to the 2023 marking and assessment boycott can be found in our article\u00a0How can I make a complaint to the university?\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Marking and results Could my marks be affected by industrial action? King's has extensive regulations in place to assure and monitor the quality of the education we provide to you and ensure that marking and assessment reflects your academic achievements and success in meeting programme learning outcomes. This includes ensuring that your work is marked and assessed by appropriately qualified subject matter experts. The impact of any industrial action on assessment would vary from assessment to assessment and module to module, so each would be considered individually. Could I submit an academic appeal in relation to industrial action? As stated within the Academic Regulations, you may appeal on either or both of the following grounds: Where there is evidence that assessment(s) may have been adversely affected by mitigating circumstances which the student was unable, or for valid reasons unwilling, to make known before the original decision was reached.Where there is clear evidence that assessment(s) may have been adversely affected by a significant administrative error on the part of the College or in the conduct of the assessment. It is not possible to appeal the academic judgement leading to your marks or your overall degree classification. For more information, please see our article\u00a0How can I make an academic appeal? Progression and graduation Would there be any impact on my ability to progress from one year of study to the next? In the event of industrial action, we would take all available steps to minimise any disruption and ensure that you could progress from one year of study to the next (or from a pre-sessional or foundation course onto your main degree programme).\u00a0You would still be able to progress pending completion of marking and/or ratification of results at a later date if required. Any programme with Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Body progression regulations would be subject to specific focus to ensure we continued to meet their requirements. Would there be any impact on my ability to finish my studies and graduate? In the event of industrial action, we would take all available steps to minimise any disruption and ensure that you could graduate at the end of your degree as normal, as long as you met the requirements of your programme. If needed, we might put in place mitigations such as re-weighting of assessments or granting of condoned credit to enable you to graduate. Any programme with Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Body progression regulations would be subject to specific focus to ensure we continue to meet their requirements. Taking exams and assessments Would exams still go ahead? In the event of industrial action, assessment periods would take place as normal. King\u2019s would put arrangements in place to ensure that all your exams would take place as planned. Please note that some faculties organise exams locally, separate from the central exam timetable; these would also still go ahead as planned. Faculties and departments would work hard to minimise any disruption due to industrial action and we would inform you in the unlikely event that your exam were disrupted for any reason. Would I be entitled to an extension for coursework, dissertations, or other submissions of work due to industrial action? Deadlines set for submitting work, including dissertations, would still apply as normal in the event of industrial action. Your faculty or department would aim to maintain assessment deadlines but would also look at whether there might be instances in which revised deadlines might be appropriate for you. You would be expected to continue to submit your assessments in line with existing deadlines. You would be notified if there were any changes to assessment submission arrangements. If my teaching and learning sessions were cancelled due to industrial action, would I be assessed on those topics in examinations or assessments? For your examinations and assessments, we would ensure that you are not disadvantaged if any learning or teaching were missed due to industrial action. We would also ensure that we maintain our academic quality and high standards. What if an in-class assessment (including oral examinations and presentations) were to not take place because of industrial action? If an in-class assessment were unable to take place because of industrial action, faculties or departments would try to ensure that the assessment is rescheduled or assessed by other means where possible. I'm a postgraduate research student, what if the oral examination for my thesis were disrupted because of industrial action? It is unlikely that oral examinations would be affected by industrial action and we would do our best to ensure that these could still take place at the appropriate time. If you had any concerns, we would ask you to please contact your supervisor in the first instance, who would be able to work with other staff members and central services if necessary.

This article is for students in The Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery & Palliative Care. For further support, contact us. Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) allows successful applicants to selected degree or diploma courses to claim 'credit' for previous learning from elsewhere, either at another institution or in practice. The previous learning must be relevant to the course applicants are applying for, and if their application is successful, the credit will count towards their chosen course of study.Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) incorporates: Recognition of prior certificated learning (RPCL), where learning has occurred through formal study at another higher education institution, within the last five years.Recognition of prior experiential learning (RPEL), where learning is gained from personal and professional experience.RPEL also includes certificated learning that occurred\u00a0through formal study, either at King's or at another higher education institution, over five years ago. You can learn more about accreditation of prior learning in the Accreditation Handbook 2022-23. Which courses is RPL for? Post-qualification courses: Successful applicants to any post-qualification MSc, PGDip or BSc course offered by the NMPC Faculty, can claim credit for previous learning that meets the RPL criteria.Pre-registration courses: There is a separate RPL process for successful applicants on our pre-registration MSc courses. Please contact the Admissions Team through the King\u2019s Apply portal for further information. Who can apply for RPL? Qualified Allied Healthcare Professionals who are offered a place on course eligible for RPL and can evidence one or more of the following, relevant to the course: Certificated learning through formal study at another higher education institution, within the last 5 years.Learning gained from personal and professional experience.Certificated learning that occurred\u00a0through formal study, either at King's or at another higher education institution, over 5 years ago. When can I apply for RPL? You can apply for RPL once your place on your chosen course is confirmed, but not before. For more details on how to apply, please visit NMPC: Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL), and you can access the application form at RPL Claim Form. How does the RPL process work at King's? Decisions about the level and amount of credit to be awarded for prior learning are made by an accreditation panel, based on the evidence that applicants are able to provide about their relevant learning experience. The accreditation panel meets once per term to review recommendations of the accreditation assessors and award credit accordingly.If you don\u2019t hold the requisite entry requirements, you may apply for advanced standing to allow entry to the programme by demonstrating that you have knowledge and skills either via RPCL or RPEL, or a combination of both, that is the equivalent of 120 credits. For example, this will allow an applicant who holds a DipHE or equivalent, to join a BSc programme. If you\u2019re intending to put in a claim for advanced standing, you should meet with a panel member to discuss the content of your application, because these claims can be substantial.If you\u2019re applying for RPL, you must discuss the potential for this with the course lead before starting the course. You can only submit an RPL application once you are enrolled on the course. Please follow the RPL application process.Important to know: There is a charge for making RPL claims.\u00a0Full details of the procedure are in the Accreditation Handbook 2022-23.

Can I change my placement? You are not able to change your placement unless you can provide evidence of exceptional circumstances. If you need to change your placement allocation, you should read the\u00a0Change of Placement Guidance\u00a0\u00a0and complete a request form. Can I change my host Trust? You are not able to choose which trust you are placed with.

Why I have been given a placement outside my host Trust? Most placements will be within your Principal Trust. You may be allocated to placements in a private hospital, or you may be allocated to an NHS trust that is not your Principal Trust. This gives you an opportunity to experience working in a different environment. It avoids overcrowding on the clinical areas in your Principal Trust and will give you the opportunity to achieve the relevant nursing proficiencies in a different setting. What if I get a placement I've already done? Please let us know by emailing us. What if I have to repeat a placement? Your Cohort Lead and/or Personal Tutor will meet with you to put together an action plan. I still have concerns about my placement, who can I talk to? In the first instance, please speak to your Key Account Manager or Cohort Lead.

If you have an accident/incident and injure yourself in some way while on placement, please refer to the guidance on Reporting incidents/accidents on placement, such as disease or injury. Can I sign for controlled drugs when on placement? As you would expect, the supply of a controlled drug is a highly regulated activity. Please check with the healthcare organisation where you are placed. You must not sign for controlled drugs unless you have received explicit confirmation that this is permitted by your Practice Supervisor. Your Practice Supervisor will provide you with information about the guidelines and requirements. Can I take bloods when on placement, if I have been previously trained in phlebotomy/cannulation? Venepuncture and cannulation and blood sampling are one of the NMC proficiencies you will need to have completed by the end of your programme, as documented in your Practice Assessment Document & Ongoing Achievement Record. This proficiency can be achieved in either Part 2 or Part 3. Your participation in this activity may vary from placement to placement, and from organisation to organisation. Please check with your Practice Supervisor and/or Practice Assessor to review opportunities for you to undertake this whilst on placement. Can I administer intravenous (IV) drugs when on placement? Nursing students are required to complete the Medicines Management assessment within your Practice Assessment Document. This includes preparing and safely and effectively administering medications, as well as correctly calculating doses for a range of prescribed medicines. Your participation in this activity may vary from placement to placement, and from organisation to organisation.

You may transfer patients and give handover by yourself only if permitted within the policies of the individual healthcare institution where you are placed, and if you are deemed competent to do so by the specific placement. However, you must have been assessed as fully prepared to manage unexpected and/or emergency situations as a lone practitioner, and therefore this activity should only take place during final placement. The accountability for the safety of the patient remains at all times, the responsibility of the registrant who delegated this task to you, therefore you must appreciate that your participation in this activity may vary from placement to placement, and organisation to organisation. Important to know: You may not transfer a patient who has an intravenous infusion in progress. When I\u2019ve completed the relevant tasks on placement, can nurses or midwives that are not my supervisor or assessor sign off skills? As a student in the Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery and Palliative Care, you can be supervised in practice by NMC registered nurses, midwives, nursing associates and by other registered healthcare professionals. Nursing students can only be assessed by registered nurses who have appropriate equivalent experience for the student's field of practice.Midwifery students can only be assessed by registered midwives who have appropriate equivalent experience for the student's field of practice. Any Practice Assessor can sign the Practice Assessment Document, even if they are not your \u2018named\u2019 Assessor for that placement. However, to promote continuity of assessment, most organisations prefer that assessments are completed by the named Practice Assessor.

This article is aimed at students in The Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery & Palliative Care. For further support, contact us. Work-based learning is a process through which health practitioners and clinical educators can gain academic credit for learning undertaken in the workplace. It is used increasingly in the health services to allow qualified staff to progress academically either at BSc or MSc levels while learning in their field of practice.We offer work-based learning modules with 15 and 30 credits attached at both level 6 (BSc) and level 7 (MSc). The modules can form part of the MSc Advanced Clinical Practice or the BSc Clinical Practice, or be taken as free standing modules. Up to 2 work-based Learning modules can be taken at each level.Educational opportunities arising in the workplace have immediate clinical relevance to practice, employers and to the professional development of individual practitioners.How is it assessed and what support is there?Our modules aim to develop critical reflection and improve people's learning skills. Students are assessed on a portfolio of activities demonstrating the learning from a work-based activity and their own development as an independent learner.\u00a0The portfolio can contribute to evidence of professional development.The academic support provided for this module is negotiated with the organisation providing the work-based learning opportunities, or with individual students undertaking their own projects in practice.Students will have an introduction to the module and the opportunity for follow up tutorials delivered by a member of the Faculty teaching staff, either in a group or individually. Students will have access to online learning resources through the university's online learning platform, KEATS.All students will have a named person in their organisation who is responsible for approving the work based learning activity and their learning plan.

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01220 Print How can I make a complaint to the university? What is an official complaint? The Complaints Policy\u00a0defines a complaint as an expression of dissatisfaction that warrants a response. However, it cannot provide an academic related outcome, such as a change in progression decision, and should therefore be distinguished from academic appeals. We are committed to considering and investigating genuine complaints from students, which we\u202fsee as an invaluable source of feedback, and undertake that any student submitting a complaint will not be treated less favourably in their university life or subsequent academic career. Important to know: Any complaints which are deemed to be frivolous or vexatious may be terminated.\u202f\u00a0The university does not accept anonymous complaints. In this article: Understanding the complaints processMaking a complaint\u00a0Making a complaint about the impact of special circumstances Understanding the complaints process Stage 1: Local informal resolution In the first instance, you should attempt to resolve any issues informally and locally with the relevant person, at the earliest opportunity. This individual will not conduct a formal investigation, but will attempt to resolve the matter quickly and informally. If no satisfactory resolution can be reached, you may escalate your complaint to Stage 2 of the complaints process. Although you don\u2019t have to, generally it is expected that you wait for the outcome of a Stage 1 Complaint before escalating your case to Stage 2. We encourage you to seek advice both prior to and during the use of the complaints procedure from any of the following sources: Your Personal Tutors or Graduate Tutor\u00a0Student AdviserDisability SupportEquality, Diversity & Inclusion teamKCLSU AdviceStudent Conduct & Appeals\u00a0Programme or student representative\u00a0Your PhD or project supervisor\u00a0The Centre for Doctoral StudiesA nominated person in the relevant service area, e.g. in Students & Education, Estates & Facilities, Library Services and Information Technology Services, as\u202fappropriate\u00a0Residences Services Manager\u00a0Assigned mentor Stage 2: Formal Investigation If you wish to make a Stage 2 Complaint, this should be made no later than 3 months after the incident complained about or the last event in a series of incidents. A complaint received after this deadline will only be accepted at the discretion of Student Conduct & Appeals. A\u202fStudent Complaint Form\u202fshould be submitted to Student Conduct & Appeals for a formal investigation to be undertaken. Important to know: The outcome of the investigation will normally be communicated to you within 25 working days of receipt. Stage 3: Appeal Following completion of a Stage 2 Complaint, you may submit a Stage 3 Appeal if you are dissatisfied with the previous outcome. Stage 3 Appeals must be submitted on a\u202fComplaint Appeal Form\u202fto Student Conduct & Appeals within 10 working days of the date of the Stage 2 Complaint outcome letter. When can appeals be made?

Provided the complaint is eligible under the rules of the OIA\u2019s complaints scheme, the OIA will look at whether King's has applied its regulations properly and followed its procedures correctly. It also considers whether any decision made by King's was fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.

Shortly before you join us at King\u2019s, we will send you an email inviting you to complete enrolment, which has four main stages, outlined below. You can also use our enrolment checklist to\u00a0help you understand the next stage in your enrolment journey and the steps you need to take to be fully enrolled as a student at King\u2019s. Stage 1: Online enrolment Step 1: Set up your IT account Your online enrolment invitation email will contain your K number (also sometimes called your King's username), which begins with the letter K and is followed by 7 or 8 numbers (e.g. K1234567), and your temporary password.\u00a0If you've previously studied at King's, you're still using the K number quoted in the email, and your original password still works, then you can skip this step and go straight to completing the online enrolment task. How to set up your IT account: Go to the\u00a0IT self-registration page.Follow the instructions to set up your security questions and answer (you'll need your K number and temporary password).Create a new password.You can now access your\u00a0email\u00a0using the\u00a0Outlook web app.\u00a0Your email address is your K number plus @kcl.ac.uk (for example k1234567@kcl.ac.uk). If you need further support accessing your email for the first time, read our article\u00a0Accessing your IT account at King's. Step 2: Complete the online enrolment task Once you've\u00a0set up your King's IT account, the next step is to complete the online enrolment task, and upload your photograph for your student ID card. The online enrolment task should take 10-15 minutes to complete, and it involves answering a number of questions about yourself in order for us to create your student record. We will also require you to answer a series of questions set by the UK Government for statistical purposes. How to complete the online enrolment task: After you have set up your King's IT account, go to\u00a0Student Records\u00a0and log in with your student number and password.\u00a0Once you've logged in, you will be taken to a page titled 'My Enrolment' where you can work through each section and answer the required questions.\u00a0When you've finished, you will be presented with a confirmation screen and you should also receive a confirmation email to your KCL email address. This email will outline if there is anything you need to do next.If you haven't done so already, you will need to upload your photo for your student ID card. Important to know: If you encounter any issues with the\u00a0online enrolment process, you'll see a 'Contact Us' button within the task that you can use to get support. Other questions frequently asked about the online enrolment task: In the online enrolment task, how do I know what my year of study is? Your year of study in the online enrolment task refers to the number of years you have been studying\u00a0at King's only. For example, if you are visiting us from a different institution but this is your first year studying at King's, your year of study should be 1 (even if you are in a later year of study at your home institution).

You'll be able to view your\u00a0timetable\u00a0once you've\u00a0completed your enrolment at King's\u00a0by logging into\u00a0KCL Timetables.\u00a0Use your K number and password to log in. You will be allocated to your classes shortly after you have enrolled. However, if your personal timetable is not yet complete, you can still view your programme or module timetables to see when classes are running. See \"How can I view my programme timetable?\"\u00a0below for more information. Do all students get a personal timetable? Most students at King\u2019s will be issued with a personal timetable and can also access their programme timetable. However, some students within particular faculties won't have a personal timetable and should instead refer to the programme timetable. Important to know: If you\u2019re studying in the Faculty of Dentistry, Oral & Craniofacial Sciences (FoDOCS)\u00a0and in years 4\u00a0- 5 of your course or undertaking postgraduate taught study, you can access your programme timetable through KEATS. What's the difference between a personal timetable and a programme timetable? A personal timetable will have details of the classes to which you are allocated and should attend. Programme timetables are the broader 'course' timetable, which shows all classes for a particular programme of study. You can\u00a0refer to your\u00a0programme timetables while\u00a0your personal timetable is still being created, for example, if you're\u00a0a\u00a0first year\u00a0and you're still being allocated to classes for your personal timetable. Once your personal timetable is completed (the first week of actual teaching), you can refer to that. There are some exceptions; some students won't have a personal timetable at all -\u00a0this is because some programmes only provide programme timetables, such as Medicine or Dentistry. Your department will advise you of this. How can I view my personal timetable? You'll be able to view your personal timetable via KCL Timetables\u00a0shortly before the start of term. You'll need to use your King's ID (e.g k1234567@kcl.ac.uk) and email password to log in. You'll be issued a personal timetable before teaching starts, but whilst staff are still allocating students to classes at the very start of the academic year, you can use the 'Find timetable' function on the left menu in KCL My Timetable\u00a0to check when classes are running. If you choose to save your view from 'Find timetable', you can remove the class later by using the 'Reset' option found via the 'Profile' button on the left menu.\u00a0You should\u00a0do this when you've been issued with your personal timetable.

Once your Student visa application is approved, you'll receive a temporary short-term travel entry vignette (visa sticker) in your passport. Your entry vignette is valid for 90 days and allows you to travel and enter the UK during the 90-day\u00a0validity dates.\u00a0You must enter the UK during the validity of your travel vignette to be eligible to enrol at King\u2019s. Important to know:\u00a0Please ensure that your visa has been granted and is valid before you travel to the UK. Entering via the e-gates If you are eligible to enter the UK border using an electronic gate (e-gates), you will need to keep evidence of the date you arrived in the UK, such as a flight ticket or boarding pass. You must provide this as part of your enrolment (the Right to Study check) and to be eligible to enrol at King's. Students need to collect their BRP within 10 days of arrival in the UK or before the expiry of their short-term travel vignette, whichever is later.

Top tips on engaging with your studies by the Disability Content Champions Understand which study techniques work for you- chances are that over the course of your studies you will identify ways of working that allow you to maximise your concentration and productivity. Developing and using study strategies which work best will surely boost your academic ability and allow you to achieve the grades that you know you are capable of! This may include using certain accessibility programmes, planning out your time in advance, and/or adjusting the formatting of your technology and course materials including brightness, font and colour. Ask for lecture/seminar materials in advance - getting to see course materials in advance is crucial to getting the most out of any lecture or seminar. Don\u2019t be afraid to contact your tutors prior to a session to ask for materials, explaining that this is a way for you to maximise your learning. It can be really daunting to explain your disability to a lecturer, or make additional requests that set you apart from other students, however, your lecturers will make the necessary adjustments to best support you. If you are to access the topic in advance, then you will be able to participate more in discussions, contribute to a richer, more meaningful discourse, and enhance your own and other students\u2019 learning, so everyone wins in the end! Find an \u2018accountability partner\u2019 who can support you to put in place strategies to reduce periods of procrastination. Why not ask a trusted friend or loved one to be your accountability partner?

This article was written by a Black student at King\u2019s who has kindly shared their experiences and tips on accessing support, connecting with support groups and getting the most out of their time at King\u2019s. Embrace your culture King\u2019s is a diverse community, and your heritage should be a source of pride. King's College London Student Union (KCLSU) runs a series of events for black students, particularly in Black History Month, while cultural societies run events and workshops that can also enrich your experience throughout the year. However, be encouraged to explore your whole identity. Coming to university in London, where there is a dominant Black culture, can make you feel like being Black means a certain way of life. Don\u2019t be afraid to try new things, new looks or new hobbies even if they don\u2019t fit other people's pre-conceived notions of what it is to be Black. Explore Equality Diversity and Inclusion Courses Consider exploring courses that focus on diversity, inclusion and social issues, if they align with your interests. Some programmes offer optional modules that provide a unique perspective to enrich your overall educational journey. For example, our Decolonising Mental Health Research module champions a decolonised and inclusive approach to education. Build a network Finding and connecting with people who share your experiences can be extremely beneficial when at university. A support network does not have to share your cultural identity, but it does often help to know that there are people who have a shared understanding of things like institutionalised racism and microaggression. And it's always good to find people who won't look at you funny if you choose not to code switch. Here are a few societies to check out: The KCL African and Caribbean Society aims to provide a platform for showcasing and celebrating African and Caribbean culture, as well as holistically providing for our members holding events that cater for their cultural, social, educational and professional requirements. The KCL Black Students Network is a community of societies and student groups that represent black students at King\u2019s College London. Member societies include: KCL Africa Futures Forum\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b KCL African Caribbean Medical Association KCL East African Society Important to know: If you need support, or have any questions prior to joining, you can contact the Wellbeing lead and speak to them about your experiences or concerns. To see all of the available clubs and societies at King\u2019s, visit our KCLSU webpages. Seek support If you're struggling with any aspect of university life, don't suffer in silence. King's has a range of different support services that can help you. Academic support Nationally, BME students are consistently awarded proportionally fewer 1sts and 2:1s compared to white students. There are many systemic reasons for this discrepancy, but its existence makes it especially important for you to reach out if you need help. You can speak to your Personal Tutor or your Faculty Wellbeing Advisor if you're struggling with your course. Similarly, don't hesitate to seek Academic support when taking assessments at King's. Mental health support King\u2019s offers support for everyone, but they also provide tailored support for students from minoritised backgrounds.

Lots of degree programmes at King's offer\u00a0placements for students. For students on health programmes, clinical placements are compulsory and a vital part of their learning and practical experience. Students in other faculties also have the opportunity to study abroad or undertake an industry placement or another kind of placement to gain valuable professional experience.Returning to study can sometimes be a challenge if you\u2019ve been in a more structured work environment for a period, so it\u2019s important to take some time to ease yourself back into university life. To help, you will continue to receive support to reflect on your experiences and what you have achieved, how that knowledge can be applied to your curriculum as well as support for your transition back into your final year of life at university and beyond. Here are some steps you can take to reintegrate back into King\u2019s: Reconnect with your fellow students through departmental networking events or at the Global Placements Celebration for students in\u00a0the faculty of Natural, Mathematical & Engineering Sciences or the King's Business School\u00a0each autumn.Meet with your personal tutor and let them know how your placement went, what knowledge, attributes, skills and experiences you gained and how they can support your future academic studies. As many of you will be returning into your final year of study, it would be worthwhile getting\u00a0recommendations on how you should approach this and to discuss any dissertation requirements.Explore different King\u2019s events\u00a0and check out opportunities through\u00a0King\u2019s Edge and\u00a0King\u2019s Careers & Employability.Join student groups, undertake\u00a0volunteering or get involved with KCLSU campaigns.Review support from King\u2019s Sport & Wellness including gym classes and BeActive.Familiarise\u00a0yourself with the Libraries & Collections provision to support your studies and King\u2019s IT guides to ensure you remember how to access all your email, files and key communications. Importantly, give yourself time to adjust and go through the motions of adaptation \u2013 everyone will return to King\u2019s having been through different experiences and you may find you acclimatise back to your studies at different points to your friends. Student Services Online can support with various questions about adjusting back to university life. Applying New SkillsWhilst a placement allows you to take the academic knowledge from your studies and apply it to the workplace, it is also a great opportunity to take what you learned on placement into your final lectures and tutorials. In the final year, your placement experience can help to: Provide inspiration for an idea to explore in more detail in your final year project dissertation.Provide clarify on your individual attributes and what most interests you for your future.Apply transferable skills, such as being able to work in a team and the ability to solve complex problems, which are all valuable assets in both your academic and professional career.Contextualise your studies and give you motivation to succeed in your final year projects and examinations.

I had to interrupt due to reasons outside of my control.So there are no examples when a full Postgraduate Loan can be paid more than once? Can I still be funded once I re-enrol?As you near your re-enrolment date, contact your funding body to let them know of your intention to resume your course. They may want confirmation of this from King\u2019s, in which case you should contact the Student Funding Office who can help you with this.Upon enrolment, any remaining balance from your Postgraduate Loans should become payable again. You don\u2019t have to reapply for the funding.Instead of the balance, can I access the full amount of loan again? I had to interrupt due to reasons outside of my control.Regrettably, there are tight restrictions on the payment of Postgraduate Loans, and usually a student can access only one of these loans, ever! So even if you have a very strong reason for the original interruption, (sometimes referred to as Compelling Personal Reasons or CPR), there are limits to the amount that can be released to you.CPRs are reasons outside of your control and might include (but is not limited to), serious ill health or a close bereavement, all of which negatively impacted on your ability to study on/attend the original course.So, there are no examples when a full Postgraduate Loan can be paid more than once?Only if you were to withdraw from your original course, successfully claim CPR and start an eligible course again, from the start; then a new, full loan would be payable.If you are thinking about doing this, please speak to the Money & Housing Advice team\u00a0and we will guide you on the process.

In this article: Can I still be funded once I resume my studies?What financial support can I expect to receive after a break from study?What happens if I exceed the \u2018standard entitlement\u2019 and need more funding?I am interrupting for reasons outside of my control, can this be taken into consideration? Can I still be funded once I resume my studies?Most students successfully return without funding problems, but this is not always the case.You could be denied Fee Loans (and Maintenance Grants where relevant) for the repeat period if you have already received the statutory funding entitlement. This is because the regulations tightly control how many times a Fee Loan (or Maintenance Grant but not Maintenance Loans) can be paid by Student Finance.This is why (in some cases) it can be detrimental to interrupt and why we advise you consult our guidance before interrupting.What financial support can I expect to receive after a break from study?Eligible students can expect to qualify for fee loans for the duration of a course plus one extra year. This is the \u2018standard entitlement\u2019 for fees. The extra year is often referred to as a \u2018gift year\u2019 or \u2018+1 year\u2019 and might be relied on should a student resume after either: Making a False Start. This is where a student starts a course but has a change of mind and does not progress beyond year 1. Instead, they opt to enrol on a new course (either immediately or in the future). The +1 year gives a student one opportunity to make a fresh start. Or...Repeating a period of study for the first time. This may happen because of a mid-year interruption or to compensate for a lack of progression from one year to the next. The +1 year gives a student an opportunity to repeat and access full funding for one repeat period, without restriction. What happens if I exceed the \u2018standard entitlement\u2019 and need more funding?The extra year allows you to repeat one year (or part year) only. If you have previously studied elsewhere or need to repeat more than one period of study, you are likely to be refused a Fee Loan until you progress further.Only Maintenance Loans (and if relevant, targeted support such as parent related grants or Disabled Students Allowances) will be paid and you will be held personally liable for any tuition fee charged for the repeat period.Currently, this must be paid in full by the 31 January of each academic year. For more information see Fee payments - when to pay.I am interrupting for reasons outside of my control, can this be taken into consideration?If you can show \u2018compelling personal reasons\u2019 (CPR) for not progressing or completing a course, you may be able to rely on discretionary funding rules to access extra Fee Loans beyond the \u2018Standard Entitlement\u2019.CPRs are not defined by regulation but typically includes periods where serious ill health; a close bereavement; or other serious incident has negatively impacted your ability to study.We advise that you inform your funding body of what has happened and provide evidence to demonstrate your situation. The\u00a0Money & Housing Advice team\u00a0can support you with your submission and help you to navigate the process.

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-02045 Print Will a withdrawal or an interruption impact my visa status? What is a withdrawal or an interruption? Please read our article How can I take a break from my course? for more information. Your department will need to approve any interruption request, so it's worth discussing this with them before you submit a request. Studying in the UK on a Student visa If you're\u00a0studying in the UK on a Student visa, you need to think carefully before making changes to your registration status as it's likely to have an effect on your immigration status. I'm withdrawing from my studies If you withdraw from your studies, then King\u2019s College London is required to report this to UK Visas & Immigration (UKVI). Your visa will then be cut short, and you\u2019ll be required to leave the UK, or apply for further leave under another visa category. For more information, see What happens if the university is required to report to UKVI that I\u2019m no longer studying?. I'm interrupting for more than 60 days If you\u2019re taking an interruption for more than 60 days,\u00a0King\u2019s College London is required to report this to UK Visas & Immigration (UKVI). Your visa will then be cut short. You'll be required to leave the UK, or apply to stay in the UK under another visa category. For more information, see What happens if the university is required to report to UKVI that I\u2019m no longer studying?. You'd need to re-apply for a new Student visa when you\u2019re ready to return to the UK.\u00a0Please see our Student Visa Interactive Guide for more information. Approximately 3-4 months before you're due to return to your studies, we recommend that you: Request a new CAS after reading our article How do I change information in my CAS?Contact our International Student Advice team if you'd like support with your next Student visa application. I'm interrupting for less than 60 days If you\u2019re taking an interruption of less than 60 days and you can still complete your programme within the validity of your current visa, the immigration rules will usually allow us to continue to sponsor your Student visa during this time. If you\u2019ve recently taken an interruption, this might not be the case. This is subject to your department approving an interruption of less than 60 days. What if I'm a postgraduate research student? If you received the automatic 3-month extension in 2020 due to COVID-19 or you've previously taken a 59-day interruption during this academic year, it's likely that an interruption could impact your end date and therefore your Student/Tier 4 visa sponsorship may be withdrawn. If you plan to study outside the UK for a period of your research, you may be able to arrange off-campus study without this impacting on your Student visa. We recommend that you discuss this with your supervisor in the first instance. This would need to be officially recorded on your student record and reported to the UKVI, even if your visa is not impacted. See more information on the King's website. If you need a short period of time away from your studies (for example, a holiday) and you don't believe it'll impact your end date, you could think about taking annual leave. Important to know: Your annual leave entitlement\u00a0of 8 weeks includes UK public holidays and university closure days.Your\u00a0annual leave would need to be agreed with your supervisor.Annual\u00a0leave would not change your submission date. Graduate route eligibility Immigration rules do change, so we advise you to check our article on the\u00a0Graduate route\u00a0up to 3 months before you\u2019re due to apply for this visa to make sure you remain eligible for it. A break from your studies doesn\u2019t directly impact your eligibility for the Graduate route, as long as you get a new Student visa when you return to your studies. The current Graduate route Caseworker guidance states: \"For the purposes of assessing the Study in the UK requirement, the caseworker must consider all periods of Student permission which were granted to study the eligible qualification that the applicant subsequently successfully completed. This means that an applicant who was unable to complete their studies in one period of Student permission, for reasons such as maternity leave or sickness, and who consequently deferred their studies and completed the course of studies at a later date with Student permission, will have all those periods counted.\" This means you'll need to return to the UK to complete your course on a Student visa and meet all other requirements for the Graduate route. What happens if the university is required to report to UKVI that I'm no longer studying? You\u2019ll receive an email from the Visa Compliance team confirming that you\u2019ve been reported to UKVI. UKVI will contact you by letter or email to confirm the date that your visa has been shortened to. We'd usually expect this to be 60 days from the date they inform you, but UKVI may cancel your visa with immediate effect. If you receive a cancellation with immediate effect and you haven't left the UK, please contact the Visa and International Student Advice team urgently, or seek external specialist immigration advice. We can\u2019t confirm how long it'll take UKVI to cancel your visa. Therefore, we advise you to make plans to leave the UK, or apply to stay in the UK under another visa category, within 60 days of being reported by the university. Remaining in the UK on a Student visa for a long period after you\u2019ve finished studying could have a negative impact on your immigration history, even if your visa hasn\u2019t been shortened yet. If you're unable to leave the UK, please seek external specialist immigration advice from professionals authorised by the Office of Immigration Services Commissioner (OISC). You can find authorised immigration advisers on the government's website under 'Find an immigration adviser'. Important to know: The immigration rules only allow you to study for a limited time on a Student visa - see the UKCISA website for more information. EU/EEA or Swiss students not on a Student visa If you\u2019re an EU/EEA or Swiss student not on a Student visa, and you're looking to either take a break from your studies, transfer to another course or withdraw from your studies, please refer to our online module EU/EEA/Swiss students and Change of Circumstances. Studying on another immigration permission If you\u2019re in the UK on another type of immigration permission, you should make sure you\u2019re aware of any implications before proceeding. You may need to seek external specialist immigration advice from professionals authorised by the Office of Immigration Services Commissioner (OISC). You can find authorised immigration advisers on the government's website under 'Find an immigration adviser'. Transferring to another institution The rules around moving to a new institution are complex and depend on what visa you have. Students on a Tier 4 or Student visa aren\u2019t allowed to transfer internally or externally without first speaking to Visa Compliance or the Visa & International Student Advice Team. Important to know: If you've read this article and you have questions about the possible impact on your visa by your change of circumstances, please contact our Visa & International Student Advice team before you take any action.

What is studying at university like? Studying at university is an exciting time and there are lots of new things to navigate. If you've already studied at university, you'll have worked out how to be a successful learner in lots of ways. You'll build on your existing academic skills and develop new ones as you study a new area. For example, critical learning skills or how to become an independent learner. How do I manage my time effectively?\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b You'll need to take responsibility at university for managing your studies. How do you manage your time now for study, work, family or leisure commitments? You might use a phone app, online calendar, journal or a wall planner. As a student you have weekly commitments as well as submission deadlines across the year. Tips for time management: Check each module handbook and add key dates and times to your calendar.Check what types of learning will be done in-person or online and what you\u2019ll need to do outside of that (e.g. using online learning resources).Use an online calendar. Plan other study commitments, such as reading and research, around these key dates/times. This will help you make the most of your live learning time.Break down longer projects into smaller tasks.Consider when and where you study best.Vary your activities. Include time for rest, personal and leisure activities, as well as any paid work.Review regularly, e.g. weekly/termly basis \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely to be perfect first time.Keep doing what works and, if it\u2019s not, try something else! Your programme handbook will let you know how many credits each module will have, and this will give you an indication of how many hours of learning you should dedicate to each one. Your department will tell you what's expected in terms of how much study time out of class you'll need to do. What\u2019s my role as a student and the role of others?\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b It's up to you to read information the university and your department sends you to make sure you understand what\u2019s expected of you on your programme. You're in charge of your learning journey, but there are lots of people around to help: Personal Tutor: Your Personal Tutor is an academic member of staff in your discipline who will discuss your academic progress with you and can chat to you about your future plans. You\u2019ll meet with them regularly throughout your programme, sometimes in a group with other students. Module Leader: Your\u00a0Module Leader/Convenor\u00a0is a teaching member of staff in charge of how your module works. You may also encounter\u00a0Lecturers\u00a0who only do one or two sessions with you because of their specialist knowledge and expertise; they will also be a great source of help if you have a question about your module content or assessment. Your department will let you know about scheduled office hours for key members of staff and how you can contact them with questions. How can I support my studies?\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Reflect on the statements in the 'Preparing for learning' section of the Starting your studies: Reflection Tool to see where you feel you're at and identify areas you want to explore for yourself and chat to your Personal Tutor about in your first and ongoing meetings.

Research is the creation of new knowledge. It can be 'blue-sky' research \u2013 driven by curiosity about what may be possible \u2013 or research focused on addressing particular issues of the day, such as healthcare or climate change. Example of research could be research done through the study of existing primary sources and materials, or by gathering or generating new data through experiments and observations. This information is then interpreted to form conclusions and answer questions. How am I a researcher? As a student at King's there are many ways that you can be a researcher. Learning how to find and critically evaluate sources, and then analyse and cite them appropriately in your own work is one. You also gain an understanding of the research culture and activity at King's. You might attend talks and events held at King's and elsewhere. You can also talk to your tutors about their research and the research by others in their field, and potentially get involved in academic research projects yourself. For example, the King's Undergraduate Research Fellowships and the Self-sourced Research Award are great ways to do this, as part of the King's Experience Research Award. To find out what research is being done at King\u2019s in your area of study, look at the Research pages on the King's website.

At King's you'll learn in several different environments: In\u00a0lectures\u00a0where you'll be introduced to and explore key concepts and ideas in your subject with a larger group of students. In\u00a0smaller tutorials\u00a0and\u00a0seminars\u00a0which will give you the chance to discuss and develop your ideas.Depending on your programme, there might be\u00a0laboratory work\u00a0or\u00a0clinical placements.You'll use our virtual learning environment,\u00a0KEATS. You will learn more about KEATS, how to navigate the online environment and much more in the\u00a0Essential Digital Skills\u00a0Programme.You will also encounter\u00a0Informal Learning Spaces.

It can also mean when you are on your own whether that is online, at home or in one of our Libraries or study spaces. How can I feel confident to speak up in class? Preparation\u00a0is key. Do the pre-class reading; think about your own opinions on the topic; talk to your classmates about it. Don\u2019t be afraid to have opinions \u2013 but also don\u2019t be afraid to change them. A big part of academic work is testing your ideas to see if they hold up. Your classes are a great place for this \u2013 it helps you and your classmates learn.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bIf you are not sure about the question, ask for clarification. If you don\u2019t understand it, probably other students don\u2019t as well! What is plagiarism and academic integrity? Plagiarism, or presenting the work of others as your own can take the extreme form of contract cheating, where students pay others to produce assignments for them. Important to know: Cases of accidental plagiarism or collusion are more common than deliberate case, however it is important know that even if you did not intend to cheat, this is still academic misconduct. Academic Integrity embodies a shared set of principles that ensure that the work of students meets the standards expected. These principles include conducting research according to accepted practices, reporting data accurately and only submitting one's own work.

On your degree programme, you will demonstrate what you have learned through the assessment that is set for you. Some of your module assessment will have criteria that breaks down the way you will be assessed and what the markers are looking for at each grade. What types of assessment will I do?\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b You will do some form of coursework and exams. Coursework is quite broad and can range from traditional essays to vlogs, poster presentations, patient leaflets, policy briefs, business reports and so on. Exams can be on paper or on a computer. Depending on your programme, you might do field trips, labs, internships, clinical placements etc. Assessment will be either summative or formative. What is a summative assessment? Summative means that assessment is designed for you to show how you meet the learning outcomes of the course and is weighted towards your final grade. What is a formative assessment? Formative is to help you practice and the best opportunity for you to get feedback. What is feedback and how do I use it? Your tutor may ask you to hand something in for them to look at, it may be part of an assignment (eg research proposal), or a first draft of a report or an outline of a presentation etc. Feedback is important because it tells you what you have done well and not so well and how you can improve for next time. You may be expected to participate in peer feedback. The point of peer feedback is for you to develop the skills of judging others' work which you will then be able to apply to your own. This will make you much less dependent on markers to tell you when you have done well, and you will gradually gain confidence in the quality of your own work before you hand it in.

All students and staff have the right to expect good conduct and professional behaviour from others, and have a corresponding responsibility to behave professionally and with good conduct towards others. Online communications must in all ways meet the conditions of the university\u2019s policies concerning communications, dignity, equality, diversity, inclusion, and respect. Staying safe online at King\u2019s When participating in any discussion forum, live seminar, or other online meeting (e.g. with a personal tutor or student support services), please take account of the following in order to keep yourselves and others safe: Treat your facilitator and other students with respect. Comments or images that would be inappropriate in a face-to-face environment are also inappropriate online. Language must always be professional and appropriate, including other members of your household that may pass in the background. When using cameras, the background should be blurred or a template should be used. Be mindful of your surroundings and use an appropriate room for video calling. Video calls should not be carried out from a bedroom unless the background is concealed. When on a video call you must wear suitable clothing, as should anyone else in the household whilst the call is taking place. If a video call is to be recorded, all participants must be notified at the start of the session. Photographs or screenshots of a video call must only be taken with verbal consent. If screens are shared at any point, the individual must ensure that all extraneous tabs or browsers have been shut down. If your programme is conducted in English you should always post contributions in English to enable everyone to understand, unless specifically requested to do otherwise. Ensure you only post messages that are related to the discussion and avoid posting the same message multiple times (\u2018spam\u2019). Be careful to only share content that you have a right to make available under any law. Messages sent in the course of the programme should only be shared with the permission from the sender, unless requested to by an administrator for site administration purposes. KEATS or other King\u2019s College London online learning spaces should not be used to advertise products or services for profit or gain. Staying safe when using social media and other online services When using social media and other online services, you should think about how activity can impact on your life (and the lives of others) outside of the online world. We recommend taking the following steps: Protect your reputation. Consider how future employers may perceive your content and comments and bear in mind the permanence of what your post. Language, nudity and activities considered or interpreted to be offensive or antisocial may impact on your employability. Avoid criminal activity. Abusive behaviour, bullying and \u2018trolling\u2019 can be illegal in some instances and may lead to criminal charges. Behaviour that is perceived by individuals to be hostile or prejudiced towards themselves or others based on perceived or actual race, religion, gender, sexuality or disability could be considered a hate crime or hate incident [Metropolitan Police]. Think about what you post. Posting content obtained through deception or breaching the privacy of others (such as secretly-filmed video or content shared with you privately through apps) not only causes pain and embarrassment to others, but may also be considered illegal. Keep your details private. Posting personal details such as your address, regular locations or student card can make you vulnerable to identity theft and other crimes. Always avoid putting your personal safety or that of others at risk. Security settings on social media can change, so review your privacy settings regularly. Take reasonable measures to prevent the transmission of computer viruses, such as not opening email attachments received from unsolicited sources. Maintain professional standards. Sharing social media content about your workplace and individuals while on placement, work experience or working in a healthcare setting may conflict with data protection legislation, non-disclosure agreements or impact on the position of a company or organisation in the marketplace. You should never assume that you have consent to share personal information on any social platform (including closed groups and messaging services). Keep passwords secure.\u00a0Make sure passwords are strong, and never share them with anyone else. Don\u2019t leave your computer unlocked with your social media or other sensitive accounts logged in. If you log into social media accounts on your phone, make sure you have a passcode set up on it.

HyFlex is a digital model of educational delivery that King\u2019s College London has invested in to support accessibility and flexibility for our students. This model delivers seminars in such a way that students can attend a class physically, or engage in the seminar\u00a0remotely. You may have noticed that one or more of the modules on your timetable is identified as activity type 'HyFlex' or 'HyFlex manual'. This simply means that some students\u00a0will be attending the session online and some will be in the classroom.\u00a0The key benefit is that it allows delivery to both online and on-campus students without having to double the number of sessions. What does HyFlex technology consist of? HyFlex technology consists of a large mobile screen with a high-quality camera, microphone, and soundbar, enabling it to be positioned within the room. Important to know: If the number of students that want to attend on-campus is greater than room capacity for that class, your\u00a0Department\u00a0will operate a rota and you will be informed of this by your class tutor. You can find more information about Hyflex, by reading the Hyflex Student Guidance on KEATS\u00a0or by contacting your Programme Administrator.

The university has automated the creation of these meetings to make it easier for updating. This article addresses key questions about accessing your classes using Teams. How do I use Microsoft Teams Meetings? Please check out the student guide for information on using Teams Meetings for detailed information on how to use Teams Meetings. Are all my sessions running through Microsoft Teams Meetings? No \u2013 this automation is only running for certain teaching events. Please do check your Personalised Timetable (or your faculty-based timetables in FoLSM) to ensure you have the most up-to-date information for the full range of teaching and learning sessions. How will I receive these Teams Meeting invites? These meeting invites will appear in your Microsoft Outlook inbox as meeting invites. They will be entitled \u2018Teams Meeting link for [Module Details]. Click \u2018Accept\u2019 to add the invite to your Microsoft Outlook/Teams Calendar. How will I know which Microsoft Teams Meetings have been automatically created? The Teams Meetings invites you receive will have the below information in the text of the invite. \u201cThis Teams Meeting invite has been automatically created for your online session. Click \u2018Join Teams Meeting\u2019 to access the session.\u201d Please contact your faculty/department with any teaching or timetabling related queries. \u00a0For any technical issues, please contact the IT Service Desk. How do I login to the Microsoft Teams Meeting invite? When it is time to access the teaching session, you can login to the meeting via either your Outlook Calendar or your Teams Calendar. What happens if I decline/delete a Microsoft Teams Meeting link which has been sent to me? If you decline the meeting invite sent to you, it will be deleted out of your inbox and out of your Outlook/Teams calendars and you will not receive a new invite. The meeting invite will appear in your \u2018Deleted Items\u2019 in your Outlook and you can move it back into your inbox from there. If you delete the meeting invite sent to you it will be deleted out of your inbox, but the meeting will still appear within your Outlook/Teams Calendars. As above, the meeting invite will appear in your \u2018Deleted Item\u2019 in your Outlook and you can move it back into your inbox from there or you can access the invite directly from your calendar and accept it there. How far in advance will sessions be created? At the moment, Microsoft Teams Meetings links will be created approximately one week in advance, so you will not see invites for the full semester. I think I have received the wrong invite, what should I do? These invites are automatically generated from Timetabling information, so you will need to contact your faculty/department to clarify what changes are needed. I am having technical issues with Microsoft Teams Meetings, what should I do? If you are experiencing technical issues with Microsoft Teams Meetings, you should contact the IT Service Desk so they can troubleshoot.

How can I choose a referee? It is a really good idea to spend some time thinking about who you want to be your referee, before you are likely to need them. You may need up to 3 referees, and it is helpful if these people come from different parts of your experience so that they can comment on different aspects of you.\u00a0 In particular, you can expect your personal tutor at King\u2019s to act as a reference for you, as they have access to your student record. Other possible referees could be: Programme or module leadersEmployers both inside or outside King\u2019sSenior academics within your department or faculty Important to know: It is important that you build a good relationship with anyone who you are likely to choose as your referee, and keep them updated about your progress and achievement in and out of King\u2019s \u2013 so they have plenty of information to include when the time comes for them to do a reference for you.It is not a good idea to ask a friend or family member to act as a referee, and indeed most employers specifically rule out these individuals. How can I approach and manage my relationship with a referee? Ask permission: It is standard etiquette that you should ask your referees\u2019 permission before putting their names down for employers to contact. Generally, you should do this each time you are applying for a position. However, this may not always be possible if you are applying for a lot at one time, or for several graduate courses. In such a case, you may want let your referee know your plans.Keep in touch: Keep in touch regularly with everyone you think you might ask to provide a reference.\u00a0 This is standard professional behaviour and is so that they know more about you, and can write a reference based on greater personal insight. Allow plenty of time: While a referee will aim to respond to a reference request as quickly as possible, you must have a reasonable expectation of your referees\u2019 availability; you will get a more considered reference if you have allowed sufficient time for it to be produced.Share information: Make sure you have provided your referees with information about the jobs you are applying for, to help them tailor the reference sensibly.Use your HEAR: Provide your HEAR to your referee, as it will contain other information that may be useful for the reference. What can I expect from my referee? Factual information: You can expect your referee to stick to the facts and ensure that all their comments can be supported by hard evidence such as exam results.\u00a0\u00a0 Confidentiality: You should expect your referees to store references in a confidential place and for as long as is appropriate: see university policies for more. Sensitivity: While referees have a duty to provide only positive feedback, please discuss with them if there are instances (e.g. poor progress, duty of candour, or criminal convictions) you need them to handle professionally and carefully. What types of references are there? There are many different types of reference and it helps to be aware of them so you can best prepare the person you ask to complete it. \u2018Pro-forma\u2019 or form The length of the pro-forma and the amount of detail it seeks varies enormously from one employer to another. It might be a detailed questionnaire asking for comments on your academic ability, positions of responsibility and participation in community life, or a one-page questionnaire inviting referees to respond to a scale of above average, average and below average in areas such as academic performance and social orientation. Pro-forma detachable from the application form Some employers have application forms where the reference request is a detachable pro-forma at the end. This method is more common in applications for postgraduate courses. You would complete your part and then pass it on to their academic referee. The confidential part of the form may ask for the your predicted degree result and comments on a series of factors such as breadth of interest in professional matters and career potential.\u00a0 Given that you know what is included in this reference, we recommending talking to your referee about it before expecting them to complete it for you. General letter Letters vary in the complexity of the information they request. Some are fairly specific and might enclose a job description or person specification asking that the referee comments on how closely you match those requirements. Other letters can be more open-ended. You may find that your referee would like you to contact the employer to ask for more details, to help them write the required letter. Telephone conversations or email requests Sometimes employers phone or email your referees to ask questions about you.\u00a0They will likely to be following a set sequence of questions. Your referee will probably ask the employer for a written record of a phone call, so they have something for their records.\u00a0Important to know: Your referee will aim to stick as closely as possible to providing facts about you rather than opinion, as there should be evidence from your time at King\u2019s to back up what they say. Open testimonial Although not common practice in the UK, you may request an open letter of reference for general use, particularly if you are an overseas student planning on returning to your home country. The content of the letter is entirely for the referee to decide, but may cover points such as: How long they have known youThe start and finish dates of your courseSomething about your general attitudeCommitment and motivation to your studiesWhether you participated in any co-curricular activities (to your knowledge)What skills you have gained from your course Can I ask my personal tutor to write a reference for me? Your personal tutor can write a reference for you if\u00a0they have access to the relevant information and you give them enough notice.Good reference protocol: Meet with your personal tutor regularly and build a professional relationship with them.Ask your personal tutor if they are willing to be an academic reference on your CV.Let your personal tutor\u00a0know when\u00a0you are applying for a job/award/course as soon as possible, to check that they can still provide a reference within the necessary timescale. Important to know: Asking for a reference with less than 2 weeks\u2019 notice may mean that your tutor cannot provide one for you in time,\u00a0so plan ahead and give as much notice as possible to your tutor.Remember to send information such as your CV, job description or any other application criteria along with your reference request. How can I share details of my academic achievements\u00a0with an employer, an institution, agency or another third party? Still studying? If you\u2019re still studying and applying for a part-time job, internship, or perhaps for further study, you can: Share the results you\u2019ve achieved so far through your Record of Agreed Results, available through your Gradintel account. Your Record of Agreed Results letter will update at the end of each year of study after your results are ratified.Provide a reference using the guidance in this article.

Graduated recently?

The National Minimum Wage is the minimum amount that employer must legally pay you per hour. Other than charities, some schools, or work placements that are a part of your course, employers are not legally allowed to pay you less than this rate. The rates differ according to your age. The latest rates can be found on the Government Website. Some employers will also adhere to the London Living Wage, though this is not compulsory. Will I be taxed on any part-time work? Everybody can earn a certain amount before they start paying Income Tax - this is known as your\u00a0Personal Allowance.

How do I look for work? Be proactive Don\u2019t be afraid to ask directly in local bars, cafes and shops. Not only does it show initiative, but many employers have part-time work throughout the year but may not advertise constantly. Be proactive. Bars, shops and caf\u00e9s often advertise vacancies in their windows and some public libraries have notice boards where private work is requested.Also look on company websites such as supermarkets, retail, bar and catering chains such as Pret, Caf\u00e9 Nero, Wetherspoons, McDonalds, Tesco.

For example, you can\u2019t be self-employed on this type of visa. Details around how much you can work should be on your visa, so we advise always checking this first.

How can I balance\u00a0working with studying? Working part-time can be a great way to fund your way through university \u00a0and give you a number of useful skills to put on your CV. However, it\u2019s important that this work doesn\u2019t interfere with your studies.Generally, we recommended that you do no more than 15 hours of part-time work per week, in addition to your studies.One of the major skills required to manage a job alongside your studies is organisation and time management. Here are a few things to consider: Be realistic about how much time you can offer towards a job. You need to consider course contact time, time for assignments and private study as well as time to rest and switch off. Don\u2019t miss lectures or seminars! Although you might tell yourself you will catch up later, it is often not the case and you may quickly fall behind. Your studies should be your priority.Wellbeing. It is important you prioritise your health and wellbeing, and so you should also set time aside for exercise and socialising with friends. Plan ahead. You may find how much time you have varies throughout the year. It is worth considering cutting back during exam times or periods of time when you have many coursework submissions. Anticipating these busier periods will enable you to be honest with your employer and they may be able to consider this when giving you your rota/offering shifts.

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01893 Print I need an agreement for me to undertake an internship, placement or work opportunity If you are participating in a structured internship programme, industry placement or consultancy project run by King\u2019s (credit-bearing), you will be expected to complete the King\u2019s Host Agreement in order to formalise your involvement. Failure to complete this may mean you are unable to participate in the programme. We know that many other students will take part in extracurricular internships \u2013 and sometimes your host employer will request documentation from King\u2019s to confirm your student status (or request that your university agrees to certain terms) in order for you to undertake the opportunity. If your employer wishes to simply confirm your student status, you can download your Confirmation of Study Letter and share this with them.\u00a0You can download a Record of Agreed Results (ROAR) if your employer is requesting confirmation of your current modular results before you have completed your programme.If you have already completed your programme, your employer may use your HEAR and the Higher Education Degree Datacheck (HEDD) to confirm your qualification at King's online. If your employer requires additional documentation, the King\u2019s Host Agreement is available for you to share with them. Please be advised that King\u2019s is unable to sign employers\u2019 own documentation or that provided by external organisations. These documents will be rejected. Unfortunately, if your employer requires documentation from King\u2019s \u2013 but is unable to sign our King\u2019s Host Agreement, you may be unable to undertake this opportunity. What is the King\u2019s Host Agreement? This tripartite documentation is facilitated by King\u2019s Careers & Employability but may require you to seek involvement from your personal tutor or academic department as it requires that you, your employer and King\u2019s all complete the document in order for us to formally approve. The King\u2019s Host Agreement satisfies our legal and regulatory requirements alongside providing a level of support to you whilst on your opportunity. Our expectations upon employers are outlined in the document to ensure your health and safety, compliance with policies and insurance regulations, guarantee of fair remuneration where legally required. It also outlines support with termination, complaints, misconduct and appeals. It has been created in line with guidance from the Universities Safety & Health Association (USHA) and ASET, the Work-based Learning Association. The Agreement is approved for use by King\u2019s legal and governance teams and is regularly reviewed to ensure compliance with all UK legislation and is sufficiently covered by European law. What the King\u2019s Host Agreement is not? The Agreement is not a contract of employment and King\u2019s maintains no contractual involvement in setting aspects such as pay, working hours, location, termination & notice periods other than ensuring our base minimum expectations are met. It is not to be used in lieu of a contract of employment, which you may sign separately, directly with your host employer. Who can use it? You are eligible to use the King's Host Agreement if you are: A currently registered student at King's College London, whose formal student status is retained until after the end of the relevant opportunity.\u00a0Enrolled in a programme of at least six months in length (either full-time or part-time) Prospective students and offer holders are not eligible to use the King's Host Agreement, neither are alumni of the institution who completed their course more than two years (24 months) ago. If the bulk of your internship takes place after you formally complete your studies at King\u2019s please follow the guidance below for the Graduate Host Agreement. You can check your formal course dates via your Confirmation of Study letter, to ascertain how much of your opportunity might be beyond your course completion. Your registered student status is not connected to your graduation ceremony but to the end of your programme of studies. Therefore, you cannot delay your graduation to extend your student status. Important to know: by completing the King\u2019s Host Agreement, we expect you to act professionally, representing both yourself and King\u2019s College London appropriately. Therefore, please consider the following best practices: Be courteous and prompt when responding to communications from employers\u00a0Consider any offers you receive fully, asking any questions relating to the role, such as timings, salary (if appropriate), expectations, training, etc., prior to agreeing and signing a contract\u00a0Once you have secured an opportunity and started a King\u2019s Host Agreement,\u00a0do not\u00a0renege on your acceptance and find a different opportunity\u00a0\u00a0The way you choose to behave may impact the employer\u2019s likelihood to work with you in future years, so behave in a way you would like to be remembered for Important Information An opportunity may only be undertaken during semester dates if part-time and up to 20 hours per week. Agreements received which do not meet this will be automatically rejected. It is the responsibility of students to undertake their own due diligence in advance of applying for an opportunity. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bYou should explicitly ask your employer when applying for, or are offered a role, whether they expect King\u2019s to complete any documentation for you to undertake the roleYou should clarify whether the role will be available to you should you cease to be a student for all or part of the opportunity\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bYou should clarify whether your employer requires you to undertake the opportunity for credit related to your course, or as part of a course of study. If it is not possible to undertake an opportunity as part of your programme, you will be unable to pursue the opportunity. King\u2019s is unable to confirm that an opportunity will form a part of a students\u2019 programme of study or is credit-bearing if this is not the case, and you are undertaking this as an extracurricular activity Key things to know about the Host Agreement An opportunity may only be undertaken by current students during semesters if it\u2019s part-time and up to 20 hours per week. Agreements sent to King\u2019s Careers & Employability or your academic department which don\u2019t meet this will be automatically rejected. It is your responsibility to undertake your own due diligence in advance of applying for an opportunity. You should explicitly ask your employer when applying for, or are offered a role, whether they expect King\u2019s to complete any documentation so you can undertake the role.You should clarify whether the role will be available to you should you cease to be a student for all or part of the opportunity.You should clarify whether you're hoping to undertake the opportunity for credit as part of your course, or simply as an extra-curricular endeavour. If it is a contractual requirement of your employer to undertake the opportunity for credit related to your course, or as part of a course of study, but this is not possible on your programme, you will be unable to pursue the opportunity.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bYour employer must possess employers' liability insurance (of at least \u00a35m) and confirm this cover can be provided to you throughout the duration of your opportunity. This is a legal requirement in the UK and where students are undertaking opportunities overseas, King's expects an equivalence or parallel legal equivalent to be provided to cover for possible incident whilst undertaking the opportunity, as part of our duty of care. Your employer should be aware of our own Agreement and that this is the only documentation we are able to sign, so you are not disappointed by not then being able to fulfil the opportunity. It is not the responsibility of the university to engage directly with your host employer, neither can King\u2019s be held responsible for an employer not being able to fulfil our expectations and obligations, or an opportunity which may be voided if your employer cannot accept the King\u2019s Host Agreement. Important to know: King\u2019s is unable to sign employers\u2019 own documentation or documentations provided by external organisations. These documents will be rejected. Unfortunately, if your employer requires documentation from King\u2019s \u2013 but is unable to sign our King\u2019s Host Agreement, you may be unable to undertake this opportunity.Minor amendments may on occasion be made to specific clauses (e.g. a change in a clause from 14 days\u2019 notice to 7 days\u2019 notice) in the Agreement at the sole discretion of the relevant King\u2019s authority or the Associate Director (Employer Engagement & Work-based Learning). Changes cannot be made to insurance or health & safety clauses and are not guaranteed to be made.King\u2019s is unable to confirm that an opportunity will form a part of your programme of study or is credit-bearing, if this is not the case. Taking up opportunities overseas The details outlined above are particularly important if you are considering an internship in a country (e.g. France, Belgium, Italy, Spain) where they commonly use an agreement called a \u2018Convention De Stage\u2019/\u2019Acuerdo De Practicas\u2019/\u2019Convenio De Colaboracion\u2019. These agreements are contractually binding and required because their employment legislation means that an intern may not legally treated as a full \u2018employee\u2019. This means your employer is not required to undertake certain checks, may not be required to pay you, or have insurance or social security in place should something go wrong.King\u2019s cannot sign these Agreements supplied by your employer. You should also check the latest King\u2019s guidance on support for international mobility, and whether travel to that country may not be permitted by the institution at that time (e.g. in event of a pandemic, natural disaster or travel advisory warning). You may be required to also complete further risk assessment documentation for us to confirm an opportunity. How do I obtain the King\u2019s Host Agreement?

King\u2019s representatives are not responsible for chasing your Host or the King\u2019s Authority to sign the document. You must initiate the Agreement at least 21 days prior to the start of your opportunity to ensure that all signatories have the opportunity to review the relevant sections.

Students on the Accredited Internships Programme will have that document sign by their Internship Module Academic convener. For all other students, King's considers the Head of Department, or when they are unavailable, the Deputy Head or Personal Tutor, as the designated King's authority that reviews and signs the agreement for internships or placements. For KBS students, the KBS Work-Related Learning team will sign these agreements. PhD students and research staff should liaise with their tutor in the Centre for Doctoral Studies.

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-02079 Print My internship/work opportunity has ended early; what do I need to know? We understand that sometimes unforeseen circumstances may require you to end your internship earlier than expected. Whether it\u2019s due to a family emergency, finding a more suitable opportunity, or any other reason, it's crucial to handle this situation professionally and effectively. It is important to end any opportunity with all parties feeling positive and with mutual agreement, to enable your long-term career success. Many companies will ask for references, which will be given by past employers. Ending your internship positively will help this reference be more favourable, which will impact your future career. In this article, we've outlined steps to help you navigate this process in a proactive and professional way. If you didn't sign a King\u2019s Host Agreement, because your opportunity is extracurricular, only sections 1-4 and 8 will apply to you. 1. Consider the reason why you want to terminate the opportunity Before making the decision to end your opportunity early, it\u2019s essential to thoroughly evaluate the reasons behind your choice. Sometimes, the challenges faced during an internship or opportunity can be resolved through open communication, negotiation, and flexibility. Also, sometimes challenges can be temporary or the result of miscommunication. Here are a variety of issues and points to consider for each of them before you decide to terminate the opportunity: Conflict with your supervisor or line manager Before ending your internship altogether, consider whether you are willing to have an honest conversation and turn the situation around. Explain your concerns calmly, clearly and professionally (Top Tip \u2013 avoid the \u201cblame game\u201d, instead of \u201cyou didn\u2019t do this\u201d, use sentences like \u201cwhen you did X I felt Y\u201d or \u201cmy understanding of X was Y, is this what you meant?\u201d). Express your desire to resolve any misunderstandings or issues. Be open to feedback and try to find common ground. In many cases, miscommunications can be clarified, leading to a more positive and enjoyable working relationship and environment. Feeling overwhelmed or underutilised Explore whether there are avenues that can help the work you are doing be more adequate and meaningful. Talk to your supervisor about your workload. They might not be aware of your situation. Discuss your skills and interests; perhaps there are tasks or projects more aligned with your abilities. Conversely, if you feel underutilised, request additional responsibilities that align with your learning objectives. (Top Tip \u2013 if you are early on in your internship it is very normal for your workload to be reduced as you settle into the role, so speak to your line manager about the timelines for your workload). Effective communication can lead to a more fulfilling experience. Personal or family emergency When things happen in our family life, it is hard to concentrate on work. Before you decide to end the opportunity, consider whether you would be open to alternative arrangements, such as working remotely so you can visit family, or working part-time or reduced hours so you can still tend to your emergency while gaining experience. Everyone goes through this at one point or another, and usually managers/supervisors will be empathic towards you and willing to make arrangements for you. However, you are not obliged to disclose information, so you can simply tell them you have had a change of circumstances. If after considering this, you still wish to end your opportunity, follow the steps outlined in sections 3 and 8. Health issues or mental well-being concerns Your health and well-being are paramount. If you\u2019re facing health issues or struggling with your mental well-being, consider discussing this with your supervisor or HR department. Many companies have support systems in place, such as employee assistance programs that they may wish to extend to you. If useful, consult a healthcare professional and request reasonable adjustments as appropriate at work. However, if this is not available to you, and you are still a registered student at King\u2019s, please refer to the well-being services we offer. More suitable opportunity elsewhere It is important to handle this situation delicately. You must thoroughly consider the ramifications of this choice before making any decisions and confirming anything with employers. Before you leave your current opportunity, you should consider how this will impact your professional reputation; whether the new opportunity is one that can be deferred until the end of your current one, and your learning: is the new opportunity going to give you something different and valuable compared to the one you are undertaking now? If you have considered this and strongly feel the new one is the one for you, handle the situation carefully by following the advice in Sections 3 and 8. Not enjoying the company culture or workplace environment If you find it hard to enjoy the company culture, consider speaking to your colleagues or supervisor about your concerns. They might provide insights or guidance on adapting to the workplace environment. If, after open communication, you still feel uncomfortable, ending the opportunity might be the best option for both parties. Remember, communication is key. Open and honest conversations can often resolve issues and lead to a more positive internship experience. If, after attempting to address your concerns, you still believe ending the internship is the best course of action, follow the steps outlined in the previous sections to handle the situation professionally. It is also important to note that just because this company or opportunity may not be suitable for you to work there at this moment in time, it doesn't mean they may not be the best employer for you in the future. Leave ensuring the door is always open to you. 2. What are your rights? (UK-based work only) This will highly depend on your contract and whether you are classed as a \u201cworker\u201d, \u201cemployee\u201d or a different term. Each term requires a different level of responsibility from the company. You can find out more on the Government website, and learn about unions that could help your case, if you feel your employer is being unfair or unreasonable. The Citizens Advice group also have some resources to help you learn what is legally acceptable and unacceptable in a work setting. 3. Communicating with your employer Explain Your Situation: Be honest and transparent about your reasons for leaving early if you wish to disclose while emphasising the positives of your experience during your time undertaking the opportunity. Discuss Flexibility: Inquire about the possibility of remote work or alternative arrangements if you wish to continue working with them, but your circumstances have changed. Some employers might be open to this, others might not. Regardless, maintain professionalism in your communication.\u00a0Ideally, you will want to carry out this communication in person, and then follow up with an email detailing the conversation and the outcome of this. For conversation starters and pointers, please see section 4. If your opportunity is remote and you do not have the chance to call your manager to discuss this, here is a template message you can email them to start the proceedings: Dear [Employer\u2019s Name], I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to discuss the possibility of ending my opportunity with [Company Name] earlier than originally planned. Unfortunately, due to [if you wish to disclose, mention the reason, e.g., a family emergency. Otherwise, you could just say \u201ca change of circumstances\u201d], I am unable to continue my internship until the agreed-upon end date of [enter original end date]. I would need to finish on [specify last day you can work]. [If you want alternative arrangements to continue working with them, add this paragraph]: Although my circumstances have changed, I am open to exploring alternative work arrangements so that I can complete the tasks I was set. For this, I would need [enter the specific arrangements, e.g. working remotely, working part-time, etc.]. Is this something you would be open to explore? I am sincerely grateful for the opportunity to work with [Company Name], and I have enjoyed my time here. I understand the importance of completing my responsibilities, and I am willing to assist in the transition process in any way possible. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further with you at your earliest convenience. Please let me know a time that works for you. Thank you for your understanding. Warm regards, [Your Full Name] [Your King\u2019s Email Address] [Your Phone Number] 4. Conversation starters for honest exchanges\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b For the situations outlined in section 1, it may be easier said than done to have these conversations. To help you take this step, here we outline a number of conversation starters/pointers to aid with this process. Bear in mind that terminating your opportunity is a last resort, and having a conversation to help overcome an obstacle or ask for adjustments might help solve your situation without having to end the opportunity altogether. Needing adjustments to continue your opportunity \u201cI have been enjoying working here. After [specify time period] at [company name], I think certain adjustments could help me work better and be more productive. Can we discuss this together to see what solutions would work best for both of us?\u201d Change of circumstances resulting in you needing remote work or less hours \u201cI need to speak with you about something important. I have had [a change in personal circumstances/a family or personal emergency] that is going to impact my work. I would love to continue working for you, and rather than leaving the opportunity early, I was wondering whether you are open to discussing [remote work/less hours] for my continued contribution to [company name].\u201d Conflict with your supervisor or line manager \u201cI wanted to speak with you about my time at [company name]. I feel we have not always seen eye-to-eye, or agreed on certain things. I have felt X when you have done Y, and this is affecting my time at the company. I would like to find a resolution together with you, so our experience going forward can be more positive.\u201d Health issues or wellbeing concerns \u201cI wanted to speak with you about something that has been impacting not just my work, but my [health/wellbeing]. Firstly, I wanted to ask if there is anything we can do to reduce the negative impact X is having on me. What mitigation methods can we adopt? Secondly, if this has not helped my [health/wellbeing] within one working week, I will need further help. Does [company name] have a health/wellbeing programme I could take part in?\u201d More suitable opportunity elsewhere \u201cI wanted to speak with you about my time at [company name]. I have really enjoyed the time here, I have learnt [insert skills], and truly value the genuine connections this job has allowed me to make with other employees. However, I am in a difficult situation. I have been offered a different position, and after thoroughly thinking about it, I believe taking this will benefit my learning as I will be able to do X and Y, which is one of my goals. I cannot pass up this opportunity, so I will have to end this internship earlier than expected, but I want to make sure I complete my outstanding tasks and help with this difficult transition.\u201d Not Enjoying Your Company Culture or Workplace Environment \u201cI need to have a conversation with you about my time at [company name]. In my time here, I have found it a challenge to truly enjoy the [culture of the company/team]. This is something that is affecting my work, and my ability to see myself enjoying the rest of this opportunity. Are there any resources the company has that could help make my time here easier, or would you have any other suggestions? I want to make it work.\u201d \u200b 5.\u00a0Did you sign a King\u2019s Host Agreement? If there is a King\u2019s Host Agreement in place for the opportunity that you wish to terminate early, below is what the King\u2019s Host Agreement states regarding early termination: Section 11 of Appendix B refers to Termination, Complaints, Misconduct & Appeals. 11.1 states the following: The Agreement may be terminated or the duration of the internship extended or shortened by mutual agreement, in writing, between the Student and the Host Organisation, provided that any extension or shortening of the duration of the opportunity is also approved by King\u2019s. 6. Understanding King's Policies For Credit-Bearing opportunities: If your opportunity is part of your course, you may need to complete the remaining hours through an alternative opportunity. Contact your academic convener or the Global Placements Team (as appropriate) immediately for guidance on this matter. For Extracurricular Opportunities: this does not affect your course, but if you have signed a King\u2019s Host Agreement, informing the King\u2019s Internships team and your academic department is courteous and can help maintain positive relationships. In both cases you will need to contact the King\u2019s Internships team or the Global Placements team if you are undertaking a Year In Industry for an Early Termination Agreement. 7. Example Email to Internships/Global Placements Team: Requesting Early Termination Agreement (only if you have signed a King\u2019s Host Agreement) Available upon engagement with us To: internships@kcl.ac.uk or Global-Placements@kcl.ac.uk (as appropriate) Cc: Your academic department or accredited internship module lead Subject: Request for Early Termination Agreement Dear [Internships/Global Placements] Team, I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to formally request an Early Termination Agreement for my internship with [Company Name]. Unfortunately, due to [mention the reason, e.g., a family emergency], I am unable to continue my internship until the agreed-upon end date stated in the original internship agreement. Below are the details required for the agreement: My King\u2019s Email Address: [Your University Email Address] Employer's Name and Email Address Who Signed the Original Agreement: [Employer\u2019s Name, Employer\u2019s Email Address] Academic Department Email Address (or Indicate Graduate Status): [Academic Department Email Address] Name of the Person Who Signed the Original Agreement on Behalf of the University (if known): [Name of the Person, if available] I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. Please let me know if there is any other information required from my end. Thank you for your understanding and assistance. Warm regards, [Your Full Name] [Your University Email Address] [Your Phone Number] 8.\u00a0Professional Closure Complete Pending Tasks: If possible, finish any pending tasks and hand them over professionally. A handover (summary of tasks you have completed, anything you have pending, and important information they should be aware of after you leave) would also be appropriate to give to your employer, to ensure they, or a colleague, can carry out your work if anything needs resolving after you have left. It also shows them how much work you have done. Express Gratitude: Thank your employer for the opportunity and express regret for the early departure. Leaving on good terms is crucial for future references, as well as potential future job opportunities. Remember, every situation is unique. The key is to communicate openly, honestly, and professionally. By following these steps, utilising the provided email templates, obtaining an Early Termination Agreement, and respecting the policies of both your employer and King\u2019s, you can navigate the early termination of your internship with grace and maintain positive relationships with all parties involved. Though now may not be the right time for you to undertake this opportunity or work with this organisation, you may wish to revisit this role/company in the future. As such, it is best to always leave on good terms and remain professional at all times.

It's essential that your university records accurately reflect your official documents, such as your passport, national ID card, or BRP, but the way you\u2019re addressed on a day-to-day basis can easily be changed. Understanding your name on record Here at King's,\u00a0we follow the British naming convention, presenting names as: First name, Middle name(s), Surname For example,\u00a0'John Paul Smith' would appear as 'John Paul Smith' in our records. You'll find spaces for: First name:\u00a0The name you are commonly called.Middle name:\u00a0Included in your full name on official documents.Surname:\u00a0Your family or last name.'Known as':\u00a0Your preferred way of being addressed. Why is it important? Your name on record is what will appear on your degree certificate, transcript, and other official documents. Having your full name ensures your academic achievements are accurately recorded against your official identity documentation. Requesting a change in your student record Updating your 'Known as' name You don\u2019t need formal documents to change your \u2018Known as\u2019 name. If you\u2019d like to be addressed differently within the university community, simply let us know what you\u2019d prefer. By providing your 'Known as' name, applicants and students give consent for use of this name by the University, where use of your legal name isn\u2019t required.This does not constitute a formal name change and will not remove other names from the record, so these will be visible to staff when appropriate.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b When and how can you do this? New students If your 'Known as' name is incorrect or not reflected during online enrolment, complete the task and inform staff when collecting your student ID card. They can update your record and make sure that your ID card reflects your preferred name. Current students If you'd like to change your 'Known as' name, contact our Student Records team through Student Services Online, and we'll promptly update it for you. Names across university systems Your name may appear in multiple places across university systems, including KEATS, your email/Microsoft account, Target Connect and more. When updating your name, you have the flexibility to choose which systems you'd like to change, where use of your legal name is not required. Within your request, please let us know where you would or wouldn\u2019t like to see this change.

I've requested a name change but something isn't showing correctly If you've requested a name change but you\u2019ve noticed that something still isn't displaying correctly in university systems, please contact us immediately. We understand the importance of accurate information so we\u2019ll promptly investigate and address any discrepancies. Transitioning to a new gender identity During enrolment and re-enrolment, questions are asked about gender as standard to fulfil our obligations for statutory reporting. You can alter your gender annually during this process, or you can contact our Student Records team through Student Services Online and we'll promptly update it for you. You don\u2019t need any formal documents to do this. If you\u2019re a transitioning student, please contact our Student Services team for advice on how to alter your gender in Student Records. Students on a visa If you're a sponsored student on a Student visa, contact us for a formal name change, and our Visa Compliance team will check any implications before making changes. If you\u2019re just making changes to your \u2018Known as\u2019 name, this doesn\u2019t require changes to your Student visa. If you\u2019re on a Student visa, your gender can be changed on your record in line with this process, but if you're issued a CAS, this will need to match what\u2019s on your passport. After the CAS is issued, it will be changed back again to your stated gender. Post-graduation name changes Degree certificates are legal documents issued in the name in which you were registered with us as a student. For alumni, names held in Student Records will only be changed and certificates re-issued if: you can provide documentary evidence of a change of gender, or\u00a0if an error identified after graduation in the official name shown on the certificate is materially impacting an alumnus e.g. obstructing a visa application. The University does not charge a fee to reissue a degree certificate in either case.

In this article: Starting your studiesTaking a break in your studiesFinishing your studies Starting your studies Am I eligible for Council Tax Exemption when progressing from undergraduate to postgraduate study? If you complete an undergraduate degree in the summer, and then go on to start a new postgraduate course in the September of that same year, it can feel like you are simply continuing as a student, especially if your undergraduate course and postgraduate course are both at King\u2019s. However, these are regarded as two separate courses, and your student status is according to your course dates. This means that you will be considered a student up to the official course end date of your undergraduate course. You will then next be eligible when your new course starts \u2013 once you\u2019ve completed your enrolment and from the official start date of your next course, as long as you meet the eligibility criteria for Council Tax Exemption. I\u2019ve completed the online enrolment task and am starting my course very soon. When can I get my Confirmation of Study letter for banking and accommodation? You can access your Confirmation of Study letter as soon as your record has updated and shows you as \u2018current\u2019 and fully enrolled. It can take a bit of time for our systems to update and reflect your new status, so we recommend allowing up to 48 hours between completing your enrolment and your letter being available for download.If you\u2019re struggling to access your Confirmation of Study letter, please read our troubleshooting guidance I\u2019m having technical difficulties accessing this letter.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Taking a break in your studies What is the difference between being on a \u2018Dormant\u2019 status or a \u2018Dormant \u2013 Resit\u2019 status? If you are told you are on a \u2018dormant\u2019 status it means you have interrupted your studies and have taken a break in your course. You could be on \u2018Dormant\u2019 or a \u2018Dormant \u2013 Resit\u2019 status; both mean interrupted, but on \u2018resit\u2019 it means you\u2019re resitting or resubmitting an assessment.In both instances, you would not be expected to attend any classes. What emails/notifications should I expect to receive about my interruption? When you interrupt, you\u2019ll receive a confirmation email.If you haven\u2019t passed assessments to progress on your course, you\u2019ll be contacted by email to your KCL email account and advised about the options available to you, such as resitting or resubmitting. If you choose this option your status on record will changed from \u2018Current\u2019 to \u2018Dormant \u2013 Resit\u2019, and you\u2019ll receive an email confirming this.After this, if you\u2019ve passed enough to progress, you will be contacted at the end of the year and invited to re-enrol for the next year of study.If you\u2019ve decided to interrupt your studies for a different reason, you will receive an email confirming the interruption. Your interruption may be for a semester or a full year; once you\u2019re due to return, you will receive an email asking you to re-enrol.Important to know: Correspondence will come to your KCL email account so we advise keeping an eye on your inbox and checking it regularly. If I\u2019m interrupted, do I still have a personal tutor and can I contact them? Yes; whether you\u2019re interrupted while resitting or simply interrupted, you still have a personal tutor assigned to you, and you can still contact them for support related to your studies. To check who this is, see Who is my personal tutor? Can I still contact academic staff in my department? Yes, if you need support with your studies, you may approach appropriate academic staff members; this may especially helpful for you if you are resitting. What happens with my student funding while I\u2019m interrupted? For details on what happens with your funding, please read: How will interrupting impact my fees and funding?\u200b Am I entitled to Disabled Students Allowance (DSA)? Unfortunately if you\u2019re on a break you\u2019re not eligible for DSA, however we do advise getting in touch the Disability Support Team; find out more in our article Funding support for disabled students. Am I still entitled to student discounts? Some discounts will be affected; for example, the university updates Transport for London (TfL) on interruptions at regular points throughout the year and this will prompt TfL to cancel your Student Oyster card. When you return to the course, you will have to reapply to TfL for this travel discount.For other discounts from organisations such as Totum or railcard discounts, please check the organisation\u2019s website for their eligibility details. Am I still eligible for Council Tax Exemption (CTE) while I\u2019m on an interruption? Your Council Tax Exemption should remain while you\u2019re interrupted if you were previously eligible for the exemption; for more detail please read our article What are the practical implications of interrupting my studies? Can I continue living in my student residence? Unfortunately if you\u2019re on interruption, you won\u2019t be able to continue living in Halls of Residence. For more details on how interruption affects your living arrangements, please see either: I\u2019m an undergraduate thinking of interrupting my studies: what do I need to consider?I\u2019m a postgraduate thinking of interrupting my studies: what do I need to consider? If I\u2019m on a Tier 4 or Student visa, can I remain in the UK? For information about how interruption affects your visa status and what you\u2019re allowed to do, we advise reading Specific information for Tier 4 or Student Visa students and getting in touch with the International & Visa Advice team for guidance. Am I allowed into campus buildings? If you have a working and valid student ID card, you will be able to access campus buildings. If your ID card is not working, it could be for a number of reasons, including expiry or a card can be temporarily marked \u2018inactive\u2019 due to lack of use.If this happens, please refer to the guidance in our article\u00a0I need a replacement student ID card. Can I still access my Confirmation of Study letter while I'm interrupted? When you\u2019re fully enrolled on your course, you will be able to access and download your Confirmation of Study letter from your student record. However, if you\u2019re on a break or resitting, your status on your record will change and this will stop the automatic download of this letter. We can still produce this letter for you manually, however we will need details of why you need it. For more details please see I need to prove my student status. What support, systems and software can I still get access to? IT access: Your access should remain, including to your KCL email account. We recommend checking in on your account for any important updates that might affect you. If you\u2019re unable to access your email account it may be that your password has expired. If this happens, refer to Accessing your IT account at King'sKEATS: You\u2019ll still have access, but any modules will be removed from your record, so it\u2019s likely you won\u2019t see anything there.Libraries & Collections: Your access may vary depending on your exact circumstances, so it may be worth checking with Libraries. If your student account is still working and you have a valid student ID card, you should be able to get access to Libraries & Collections.If you\u2019re unsure or find you can\u2019t access something you\u2019re looking for, you\u2019re best to contact the Library team and they can check if there are any blocks on your library account.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bStudent Services: You can always get support from Student Services by accessing any article on Student Services Online or by logging a case with the Student Services Frontline team. Finishing your studies Am I still considered a student until my graduation ceremony? Your graduation ceremony is an occasion to mark and celebrate your achievements and the end of your studies. However, \u2018to graduate\u2019 means finishing university and getting awarded your degree. This means that you graduate when your course has officially ended \u2013 your official end date will appear on your student ID card, Confirmation of Study letter and other documentation such as your HEAR.For most students, there can be a couple of weeks or even a few months between their official course end date and ceremony date; during this time we consider you completed and graduated. Are there any exceptions? The only exception would be if you are in the process of getting an extension or resitting; this may mean your expected course end date is pushed to a later date. It can take a few days for this process to take place and for your record to be updated to reflect this. But once it is, it will appear on any letters we produce, and we recommend replacing your student ID card to show the new expected end date. Important to know: When you officially finish your course you are no longer considered a student, which means you will also stop being eligible for student discounts \u2013 this includes Council Tax Exemption. For more information about this, please refer to Who is exempt from paying Council Tax?Finishing university can be both an exciting and challenging time, and there is still support available to you as a graduate and alumni of King\u2019s. We recommend reading our articles in our Graduation category which addresses the key topics relevant to you when finishing university. In particular, we recommend these articles: Staying connected after graduationWhat support services do I have access to as a graduate?I need to prove I\u2019ve graduatedBanking and finance after graduating Am I still considered a student until my results and award are released? How quickly you receive all your ratified results and your degree award, depends on when the relevant Assessment Sub Board for your faculty meets to finalise this. This means different faculties/departments across the university may release results at slightly different times.However, you are considered a student until the official end date of your course; for most undergraduate students this will be May or June, for most postgraduate taught students this will be the end of September, and for postgraduate research students this will vary. In all cases, your official course end date will be stated on your student record and will be stated on your student ID card and on any letters we issue. Are there any exceptions? The only exception would be if you are in the process of getting an extension or resitting; this may mean your expected course end date is pushed to a later date. It can take a few days for this process to take place and for your record to be updated to reflect this. But once it is, it will appear on any letters we produce, and we recommend replacing your student ID card to show the new expected end date.

For more information about this, please refer to Who is exempt from paying Council Tax?I\u2019m waiting for my assessment results; where can I find out more?If you would like to find out more about when and how to expect details of your results, we recommend reading\u00a0When will my exam results be available? If you think you may need to apply to resit or for an extension: What are mitigating circumstances? If you have completed all your exams and submitted all required coursework, but haven\u2019t yet received your results and need to prove your status during this \u2018in-between\u2019 period, we recommend referring to these articles: I need to prove I\u2019ve finished my course and am awaiting resultsI need to prove I am highly likely to succeed on my course I have submitted my thesis and now I can\u2019t access my Confirmation of Study letter; does this mean I am no longer considered a student? As with all students, you\u2019re considered a student until the expected course end date on your student record. If you\u2019re a research student and have submitted your thesis, your record will update your enrolment status code, and this can stop the automatic letter from working. We can check your record and find out why you can\u2019t access your letter. We can produce a letter for you manually, just make sure you let us know why you need it when logging a case.

I am studying from a different country, and my online classes are very early or very late in the day Classes are taught from within the UK timezone. If you have been allocated to classes at a time which is difficult to attend in your local timezone please speak to your\u00a0department. Is it possible to change the time of my classes, for example due to religious observance? The time and day of classes are determined by several factors, which include preventing clashes\u00a0(not everyone will be on the same programme as you, so might\u00a0have to attend lectures that you don\u2019t), staff and room availability, and academic requirements. Your department might\u00a0specify a minimum length of time between the lecture and seminar, for example, to allow for information to be absorbed and researched. With this in mind, you should always approach your department in the first instance to discuss changes to your timetable. I have back-to-back classes, how can I get to my next session on time? If you are moving between campuses, then you should have enough time built into your timetable to travel; please speak to your department if this is not the case. If you are moving between classes on the same campus, then please bear in mind that you are likely to have classes back to back as teaching should end 5 minutes before the hour and begin 5 minutes after the hour. This should allow enough time for classes to change over. If you are studying online, there should still be time to switch between classes. If you find you are struggling to have enough time to switch \u2013 please speak to your department. I have some gaps between classes, can this be changed? In the early part of a semester, we might\u00a0be able to assign you to a different class. Your department will need to approve these requests\u00a0first, so always start your enquiry with them.\u00a0It might\u00a0not be possible as the semester progresses, or\u00a0if a class is already full. In some cases, your department will have dictated the allocations for pedagogic reasons. Where can I find the invitations to my live online classes? Online classes will usually be delivered via Teams. You will be sent invitations to these classes via your King\u2019s email account. If you are expecting an invitation for a class but haven\u2019t received one please speak to your\u00a0department.

Things in life don\u2019t always go according to plan. We hope that your time at King\u2019s College London will be an enjoyable experience and on the whole, stress-free.However, we recognise that everyone goes through difficulties at certain times in their lives, and a break from study may be appropriate.If you're struggling to engage with the course due to ill health, personal, financial or other reasons, your department may allow you to take a break from your studies. We call this an \u2018interruption\u2019. This means that you can return to your course at an appropriate point once you've had time to deal with your problems. Important to know: You can apply for an interruption at any point in your studies, but there are certain situations where it may be more fitting to apply for mitigating circumstances rather than an interruption. Discuss your options with your department or faculty first. Things to consider before interrupting If you live in a hall of residence, it is unlikely that you will be allowed to remain there, continue to receive student funding, but there may be flexibility depending on your personal circumstances and the reasons for interruption. You should, however, remain in contact with your department and you can access the university Student Services. For more details of things to think about, please refer to: I\u2019m an undergraduate thinking of interrupting my studies: what do I need to consider?I\u2019m a postgraduate thinking of interrupting my studies: what do I need to consider? You may also find our guidance in\u00a0I'm not sure if I should leave my course or just take a break\u00a0helpful for support options. Process for interrupting In the first instance, we advise that you speak to someone in your department, ideally your personal tutor or supervisor about your concerns and worries, and ascertain how long a break you need and when would be a good time to return to your studies.\u00a0There can be practical considerations, especially for students attending clinical placements, which will need to be factored into a suitable return date.\u00a0Step 1: Contact your personal tutor or supervisor to discuss your situation.Step 2: Read either I\u2019m an undergraduate thinking of interrupting my studies: what do I need to consider? or I\u2019m a postgraduate thinking of interrupting my studies: what do I need to consider?Step 3: We recommend that\u00a0all\u00a0students considering a break from studies\u00a0speak to\u00a0Advice Services\u00a0to talk through the practicalities of taking a break; this can include your funding, accommodation arrangements and immigration status.\u00a0Step 4: To process your request online form\u00a0in your student record; select 'Initiate Change of Circumstances'.Important to know:\u00a0If you are on a Student visa, you are required to speak with an\u00a0International & Visa Adviser\u00a0before your\u00a0interruption can be finalised as there are significant implications for your student visa and return to study. What happens next? If you have read the articles related to this one and you are not concerned by anything you have read, then you don\u2019t have to do anything further. Your department will be asked to finalise your request. Once everything is completed, you will be sent an email your King\u2019s email address, confirming that your record has been updated.They will also advise you on the final tuition fee charge and ensure your funding body learns of your decision to interrupt. We recommend that you also contact your funding body to update them on your decision to interrupt.Important to know: When you complete your Change of Registration Form via Student Records you will be asked if you have already consulted Advice Services. Tick \u2018yes\u2019 if you have received advice or are satisfied that the information in our related articles have answered all your questions. Tick \u2018no\u2019 if you have not spoken to us yet but would like to.If you are interrupting on health or financial grounds Change of Circumstances form may be referred to Advice Services for approval and recommendations before processing your application with your department. This is to make sure that you have been fully advised on any consequences, which may affect you now or in the future. As outline in Step 3 above, we advise all students considering an interruption to contact Advice Services to discuss your situation fully. Your adviser will confirm that you have received the appropriate advice on the change of registration form and return it to your Record Centre.If you have any questions on the university\u2019s policies on data protection, you should refer to the Student Data Collection Notice and Privacy Statement. Have concerns about interrupting but already submitted your request? If you have already submitted a request to interrupt, it is probably best to contact your department or your Record Centre\u00a0so they can delay finalising your change of registration and give you time to speak to someone. To log your request, follow the link to submit an enquiry:\u00a0Student Records.If you require advice and guidance about the circumstances surrounding your interruption, any of the issues raised above or would just like to review your options please contact Advice Services.

Important to know: If you are studying on a Student visa you must consider the implications for your visa if you decide to interrupt. For this please read\u00a0Visa implications\u00a0of interrupting. In this article we address the financial implications of taking an interruption in your studies, for more guidance about other things you may need to consider before interrupting, such as your Student visa, housing, council tax and access to support, please refer to: Will a withdrawal or an\u00a0interruption impact my visa status?What are the practical implications of interrupting my studies?How can I take a break from my course?Interruption of Study Policy We recommend talking your decision to interrupt through with your personal tutor. You may also wish to seek advice from the Money & Housing Advice Service in relation to your funding. Undergraduates If I interrupt before the end of the academic year, will I still pay the full years\u2019 tuition fees? The amount charged is usually determined by the last day you were \u2018actively engaged\u2019 on the course (exceptions are outlined below). You should read all of the guidance and speak to your personal tutor before completing the Change of Registration Form on Student Records so that you can agree your interruption date and an appropriate date to return to the course.The longer you have attended the course the more fees you will be charged for the year. If relevant, this \u2018last day\u2019 will also influence the amount of living cost support paid by your funding body. Are there any exceptions to this fee rule? Yes, there are some courses where the charging arrangements differ. This is likely to be the case for King\u2019s Digital courses, International Foundation Courses and other short courses offered at King\u2019s.Please speak to your department directly or Student Records for more specific information about these programmes. I am responsible for paying my own fees and have paid in advance. Can I expect a refund? Once your interruption is finalised, your tuition fee will be recalculated by Student Records. Credit Control will issue a new invoice and if there is credit on your account, you can request a refund via Student Records or leave the funds until you return to study. For more detail you can take a look at the Student Fee Payments FAQs. Your contact about your record will vary slightly depending on your faculty: If you\u2019re within the Nursing faculty, please get in touch with Nightingale Student Hub\u00a0through Student Services OnlineIf you're in any other faculty, please get in touch with\u00a0Student Records Student Finance paid my tuition fees direct to King\u2019s - what if they have paid King\u2019s too much? If you are funded by Student Finance England (SFE) or regional equivalents, the university will inform them about the change of registration and alert them to any revised charges. This will prompt them to adjust the Fee Loan paid.Sometime later, you should receive a new financial assessment document from your funding body with the updated Fee Loan figure.Important to know: Students with US Loans should speak to the Student Funding Office. Student Finance helped with my living costs too - will interrupting impact on maintenance support? When your funding body amends the Fee Loan, they will also reassess Maintenance Loans and/or Grants where relevant. Like Fee Loans, these are only paid for as long as you remain enrolled unless you interrupt for health or caring responsibilities, in which case, your funding body will extend your funding by an extra 60 days.Important to know: As this type of funding is usually paid to you in advance, a mid-year reassessment is likely to result in your entitlement being reduced and an overpayment being identified. Your funding body will write to you about this as they are likely to seek immediate recovery of that overpaid amount. I thought that loans were only repayable once I graduated and earned over the \u00a325,725 threshold? Yes, that is usually the case but when you interrupt, if you were paid for a whole term but did not complete it, this will trigger an overpayment request. Money paid towards periods that were completed will not be demanded and are repayable as normal at the end of your studies. I receive an NHS Bursary, will they also make a request for money back if I interrupt mid-year? Yes, once the NHS are informed of your interruption, they will review your funding and depending on dates, if an overpayment is identified you will be asked to repay this. However, you may continue to receive your NHS funding for short periods of ill health, provided that this is authorised by the faculty/department office. If a significant break from study is required funding will be suspended. The NHS has a maternity leave policy which can provide funding to students taking a break to have a baby. For more information, check\u00a0the NHS FAQ Can I receive an NHS Bursary during maternity or adoption leave? If you received this funding because you are on a Nursing, Medicine or Dentistry course, please contact your department/faculty directly for guidance.\u200b\u200b\u200b I have spent all my maintenance funding. What should I do if I cannot repay it all immediately? Once you hear from your funding body, your options will be explained. Typically, these will include: Making an immediate repayment where you can orHaving future funding reduced to help cancel out the overpayment.In some instances, with Student Finance, you may be able to defer the repayment until you complete the course, if an earlier repayment would put you in severe hardship. For more details about overpayments and deferring repayment visit Student finance if you suspend or leave your course. I still have rent and bills to pay but I am too ill to work, how will I manage without student finance? If you have ongoing financial commitments and are unable to work (or receive financial support from your family or partner) you can ask SFE to continue payments, so as to avoid serious financial difficulty.Important to know: We strongly advise you to consult a specialist Money Adviser about how to do this and the evidence required. Postgraduates If I interrupt before the end of the academic year, will I still pay the full years\u2019 tuition fees? The amount charged is usually determined by the last day you were \u2018actively engaged\u2019 on the course (exceptions are outlined below). You should read all of the guidance and speak to your personal tutor before completing the Change of Registration Form on Student Records so that you can agree your interruption date and an appropriate date to return to the course.The longer you have attended the course the more fees you will be charged for the year. If relevant, this \u2018last day\u2019 will also influence the amount of living cost support paid by your funding body. Are there any exceptions to this fee rule? Yes, there are some courses where the charging arrangements differ. This is likely to be the case for King\u2019s Digital courses, International Foundation Courses and other short courses offered at King\u2019s.Please speak to your department directly or Student Records for more specific information about these programmes. What if I have paid too much? Can I expect a refund? Once your interruption is finalised, your tuition fee will be recalculated by Student Records. Credit Control will issue a new invoice and if there is a credit on your account you can request a refund via Student Records. You can also leave the funds on your account until you return.Important to know:\u00a0If you have paid a non-refundable deposit, this could cancel out a refund, depending on the figures. Please refer to\u00a0Student Fee Payments\u00a0for full details. I used a Postgraduate Loan to pay my tuition fees, will this money still be refunded back to me? Postgraduate Loans are paid directly to students and are intended as a contribution towards postgraduate study. You can choose how you spend that loan and if you used it towards your fees then any overpaid amount will be refunded back to you. If I interrupt, do I have to repay the Postgraduate Loan back to my funding body? If you have accessed a Postgraduate Loan and interrupt mid-course, King\u2019s has a duty to inform your funding body of this change. This is because instalments paid are linked to attendance so, in some cases you may find an overpayment is identified once your last day of attendance is confirmed to them. Your funding body will write to you about this and explain your options for settling this bill. I thought my Loans were only repayable once I started working and earning over the \u00a321,000 threshold? To a large degree, this is true. However, the Postgraduate Loan is usually paid in instalments and their release is dependent upon attendance each term. So on occasion, where an instalment is paid (assuming attendance), but later the funding body learn of an earlier interruption, an overpayment notice may be sent out to cover the instalment paid in error.\u00a0You can help avoid this by contacting your funding body as early as possible, to update\u202fthem on your change of registration. I've been awarded a scholarship/bursary. What happens to that funding if I interrupt? If you have been awarded a scholarship or bursary, it is important to check whether there are implications when taking a break or leaving early. If you have been given written terms and conditions governing the payment, then refer to those for guidance.\u00a0\u00a0If you are a postgraduate research (PGR) student, you can also speak to the\u202fCentre of Doctoral Studies\u202fif you have any further queries about how the funding is disbursed.

If you are registered with the\u00a0King's NHS Health Centre\u00a0you can arrange to see a doctor there, otherwise you can attend\u00a0your local GP surgery or visit an NHS walk-in centre. For more guidance on what to do if you become pregnant while studying, read our article What do I do if I become pregnant while studying?

Who to talk to Changing your registration and deciding to interrupt your studies or withdraw entirely, is big decision and not one to be made without guidance from support from King\u2019s.First consider your options and talk them through with a personal tutor, Student Support and Wellbeing Services,\u00a0Careers Consultant, parent or friend. Ask yourself what you would rather do and if you want to return to the course at a later date. You may also wish to consider your long-term career plans and the impact your decision may have on your finances. If you are an international student subject to immigration control, it's\u00a0essential that you\u00a0contact the Visa & International Advice Team\u00a0about how withdrawal/interruption affects your visa and right to remain in the UK.Important to know: If you decide to withdraw permanently, you will have to reapply should you wish to return to the university.You talk should through your reasons for leaving the course with relevant support staff before you leave. This is to ensure that you are making the right decision for you, and that you are aware of any problems you may have as a consequence of withdrawing or taking a break from your studies. There are people you can talk to discuss your situation with, and help you make a fully informed choice: Personal tutor Your\u00a0Personal Tutor\u00a0is your first point of contact within your department if you have concerns about your progress on the course. They will listen to you sympathetically and make some suggestions that you may not have thought of. It may be that all you need is some encouragement or perhaps some help in planning your work schedule.If you need academic support your Personal Tutor will be able to point you in the right direction. However, they will not try to persuade you to stay on the programme if it's not in your best interest. Money & Housing Advice and Visa & International Student Advice The Money & Housing Advice team and Visa & International Student Advice team will listen in confidence and present you with your options. They can also advise on the consequences of withdrawing or taking a break from your programme in relation to funding, benefits, housing and immigration.Students often approach the Money & Housing Advice and/or Visa & International Student Advice teams with practical problems that seem insurmountable and these might be affecting your ability to remain on the course. Advisers can help with debt, benefit claims and appeals, visa/immigration applications and housing issues as well as a range of other practical issues that students may have. If we are unable to assist we\u2019ll help you to find advice from another source. All discussions are held in confidence. Counselling & Mental Health Support Service If personal problems are affecting your studies you may wish to speak to a\u00a0Counsellor\u00a0before deciding to make any changes.

There are lots of things to consider before interrupting. We recommend you read the guidance carefully and take the time to talk to your personal tutor and the Student Support and Wellbeing Services to make sure you fully understand the practical implications of taking a break from your studies. If you're a considering interrupting, read our article How can I take a break from my course? You can also refer to the Interruption of Study policy. Fees and Funding Tuition fees Tuition fees will be charged from the start of the academic year up to the date on your \u2018Change of Registration Status\u2019 form, even if you have not been in attendance.\u00a0\u00a0If you pay your fees with a loan from Student Finance England, the university will notify them of the change and re-invoice for the correct fee. If there are any problems please contact the\u202fMoney & Housing Advice Team\u202fas soon as possible.\u00a0For more information, read our article How will interrupting impact my fees and funding?\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Student Loans (Home and EU students) Student Finance England generally provide one additional year of funding above the length of your course. If you decide to undertake a university degree in the future, in most cases you will lose one year's funding from the new course for every year (including partial years) you have previously studied. If you undertake an NHS funded course you may get some or all of the funding on offer. We strongly encourage all students to\u202fspeak to\u202fthe\u202fMoney & Housing Advice Team\u202fabout these issues before formally withdrawing from the programme.\u00a0For more information, read our article How will interrupting impact my fees and funding?\u200b\u200b Student Visa Studying in the UK on a Student Visa If you\u2019re studying in the UK on a Student visa, you need to think very carefully before making changes to your registration status, as this will have implications on your immigration status. If you\u202fwithdraw\u202ffrom your studies, then King\u2019s College London is required to report this to UK Visas & Immigration (UKVI). Your visa will then be cut short, and you\u2019ll be required to leave the UK, or apply for further leave under another visa category. If you\u2019re outside the UK, you won\u2019t be able to return on your current (Student) visa.\u00a0If you want to\u202ftake a break\u202ffrom your studies, have a look at our article\u202fWill an interruption affect my Student visa status?If you\u202fdefer\u202fyour studies, the impact on your visa status will depend on the period of time that you won\u2019t be required to engage with study, so you should check this with your department first. You should then contact our\u202fVisa & International Student Advice Team\u202fdirectly to discuss the visa implications. Important to know: The immigration rules only allow you to study for a limited time on a student visa \u2013 see\u202fUKCISA\u202ffor more information. If you have any questions about the visa implications of your change in circumstances after reading the information above, you should arrange to talk to our\u202fVisa & International Student Advice Team\u202fbefore taking any action. EU/EEA or Swiss students not on a Student visa If you\u2019re an EU/EEA or Swiss student not on a Student visa, and you're looking to either take a break from your studies, transfer to another course or withdraw from your studies, please refer to our online module EU/EEA/Swiss students and Change of Circumstances. Studying on another immigration permission If you\u2019re in the UK on another type of immigration permission, you should make sure you\u2019re aware of any implications before proceeding. You may need to seek\u202fexternal specialist advice, or can contact the\u202fVisa & International Student Advice Team, who will refer you as appropriate. Transferring to another institution The rules around moving to a new institution are complicated and depend on what sort of visa you have. Students on a Tier 4 or Student visa need to first speak to Visa Compliance or the\u202fVisa & International Student Advice Team before being allowed to transfer internally or externally. Housing Living in university accommodation If you decide to withdraw from your course or interrupt your studies, it's not possible to remain living in university residences, although you will be given a short time to find alternative accommodation.\u00a0\u00a0You\u2019ll need to speak to the Residences team about organising an early release from your contract. They will be able to advise further about moving out dates and how the early-release impacts on the rental charges. You can\u202femail\u202fResidences or call on 020 3660 2662.You will be charged for the full amount of Residence fees for the time you have been in residence. This will be calculated according to the date agreed on by you and the Residence Manager. The appropriate form to submit can be obtained from the Residence Team or your Residence Manager.\u00a0\u00a0You must complete this form in addition to the online \u2018Changes to Registration Status\u2019 form. \u202fIf you are living in other residences you will need to check their policy locally.\u00a0Important to know:\u202fThere are exceptions we can consider, such as if you estranged from your family. Please contact the\u202fMoney & Housing Advice team\u202fto discuss your housing options during your break in this situation. Living in private accommodation If you live in private halls, or at a private rented property, then you should check your contract for terms and conditions. It may be that you are unable to break the lease early, even though you are interrupting from the course.\u00a0Please contact the\u202fMoney & Housing Advice team\u202fif you need further advice and support with this. Council Tax Withdrawing Once you formally withdraw from your programme you lose your student status and are required to pay Council Tax. If you live alone or if the rest of the household comprises of students you can apply for a 25% single person discount. Interrupting If you are interrupting you should maintain your student discount as you remain a student until the point where you complete the course, withdraw from it or are asked to leave. \u202fIf your circumstances are different or if you have some concerns about Council Tax please contact the\u202fMoney & Housing Advice Team.\u00a0For a better understanding of Council Tax and what it\u2019s for, and who is exempt, please read\u202fWhat is Council Tax and am I exempt from paying it?\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Benefits and Financial Support How is access to welfare benefits affected by my interruption? While you are on an \u2018interrupted\u2019 status, you retain your full-time student status so generally, the rules around accessing welfare benefits continue to be restrictive. It can be a complicated picture and seeking further advice from\u202fMoney & Housing Advice team\u202fwould be advisable, particularly if you are interrupting due to ill health or caring responsibilities. Will I lose my Disabled Students Allowance (DSA)? Unfortunately if you\u2019re on a break you\u2019re not eligible for DSA, however, we advise getting in touch with the Disability Support & Inclusion Team; find out more in our article\u202fFunding support for disabled students. Access to support What support, systems and services can I still access from King\u2019s whilst interrupted? Access to Libraries and other learning resources should remain available but may be restricted. We advise checking with your department for full details and how to keep in contact while you are on a break.\u00a0\u00a0You can always get support from Student Services by accessing articles on\u00a0Student Services Online\u00a0or by\u00a0logging a case\u00a0with the Student Services Frontline team.

If you\u2019re unsure\u202for find you can\u2019t access something you\u2019re looking for, you\u2019re best to contact the\u202fLibrary team\u202fand they can check if there are any blocks on your library account.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b If I\u2019m interrupted, do I still have a personal tutor and can I contact them? Yes; whether you\u2019re interrupted while resitting or simply interrupted, you still have a personal tutor assigned to you, and you can still contact them for support related to your studies. To check who this is, read\u202fWho is my personal tutor? Can I still contact academic staff in my department? Yes, if you need support with your studies, you can approach appropriate academic staff members. This may especially helpful for you if you are resitting. Local NHS care If your care is currently being provided in London and you live elsewhere, we advise speaking to your care provider or GP to look at how you can ensure continuity of support whilst you are not resident in London. This may include asking them to make a referral to NHS services in the location where you will be living whilst on interruption. Student discounts Will I lose my Student Oyster card? You receive this discount because of your enrolment, so once you interrupt, you will eventually lose it. The university updates Transport for London (TfL) on interruptions at regular points throughout the year and this will prompt them to cancel your Student Oyster card. When you return to the course, you will have to reapply to TfL for this travel discount.

To ensure that withdrawal is a suitable option for you and that you are fully aware of the impact this may have on funding, housing and future study, it is strongly advised that you discuss your case with both your personal tutor and Advice & Guidance before making your final decision. We have lots of information and advice about\u00a0Who to talk\u00a0to\u00a0in our article\u00a0I'm not sure if I should leave my course or just take a break.Important to know:\u00a0If you are studying on a Student Visa, please refer to our guidance on\u00a0Visa implications\u00a0and sure to consult with\u00a0Visa & International Adviser\u00a0before making your decision.In this article we address the considerations you need to think about before submitting a withdrawal request: Key considerations when withdrawingFees & funding when withdrawing Key considerations when withdrawing What happens with my fees and funding? We cover this in detail in Fees & funding when withdrawing. What will happen about my housing? If you are living in King\u2019s Accommodation, once you stop studying, you will need to find alternative housing as Halls are exclusively for students. You\u2019ll need to contact the Residence Team about terminating your contract and agreeing a move out date by email\u00a0or by phone on 020 7848 5959.If you live in private halls or at a private rented property, then you should check your contract for terms and conditions. It may be that you are unable to break the lease early, even though you are withdrawing from the course. Get in touch with\u00a0Money & Housing Advice if you need further support with this. Will I lose my TfL Oyster student discount once I withdraw? You attract this discount because of your enrolment at the institution, so once you leave, you will eventually lose this concession. At certain times of the year, the university must update TfL on withdrawals and this will prompt them to cancel your student discount card. What happens with the Council Tax Exemption or discount that I have enjoyed at my property? This is linked to enrolment on a full-time course so once withdrawn, you lose this discount or exemption. You are responsible for updating your Local Authority as they will need to review your council tax bill to take into account this relevant change of circumstance. How are welfare benefits affected by my withdrawal? Once you stop studying, you are no longer a student and therefore, should be free to apply for welfare benefits, if you need them. The usual restrictions on full time students should no longer apply.On the other hand, if you are someone who has continued to access welfare benefits whilst studying, for example, you are a lone parent; then make sure that you update the benefit provider that you have left the course, so they can take this relevant change into consideration. For means tested benefits, this is likely to result in an increase in your entitlements as student loan income is likely to be reduced.If you\u2019re unsure about this and would like advice, you may wish to contact Citizens Advice. What if I am unsure about what to do with my future. Who can give me some guidance? It\u2019s very common for students to be unsure about the future. You may benefit from speaking to the Careers and Employability Team here at King\u2019s. They can help you identify your skill set, interests and pathways towards your next adventure. Fees & funding when withdrawing If I withdraw before the end of the academic year, will I still pay the full tuition fee? If you apply to withdraw permanently from King\u2019s then the date of your application is taken as the date of withdrawal.During the approval process of your application, your department will verify this date and identify whether this should be changed to the last date of attendance (normally when your circumstances have meant you were unable to\u00a0submit an application sooner). Your fee liability will\u00a0normally\u00a0be calculated based on the full fee for the academic year, divided by the number of teaching weeks for that year of study and then multiplied by the number of actual weeks before your withdrawal date.\u00a0This revised fee will be notified to you when you receive your confirmation of withdrawal email. You can find more detailed information on fee calculations on the\u00a0Student Fee Payments Withdrawals and Interruptions. In exceptional circumstances, where there has been a delay in submitting your withdrawal due to unforeseen circumstances, such as ill health, it is worth discussing this with your department, as this may help to reduce the final charge. Are there any exceptions to this fee charging policy? Yes, there are some courses where the charging arrangements differ. This is likely to be the case for King\u2019s Online Courses and the International Foundation Courses. For more information please visit Tuition Fees: Withdrawal and Interruptions. I am responsible for paying my own fees. Can I expect a refund if I have overpaid? Once the withdrawal is finalised, your tuition fee will be determined and confirmed by Student Records. They will advise Credit Control (Finance) who will update your charge, if necessary, and if at that point you have overpaid, you can request a refund via Student Records. For more information on refunds visit Student Fee Payments FAQs. I used a fee loan from Student Finance to pay my tuition fees. What if they have paid King\u2019s too much? If you are funded by Student Finance England (SFE) or regional equivalents, the university will update them about the change of registration and alert them to any revised charges. This will prompt them to adjust the fee loan paid so you will not overpay and you will receive a new financial assessment document. Student Finance helped with my living costs too. How will withdrawing impact on maintenance support? When your funding body amends the fee loan, they will also reassess maintenance loans and where relevant, grants. These are only paid for as long as you remain enrolled, and because this type of funding is usually paid to you in advance, a mid-year reassessment is likely to mean reduced entitlements and an overpayment being identified. Your funding body will write to you about any funding that need to be repaid. I thought my loans were only repayable once I started working and earning over the \u00a325,750 threshold? If you were paid for a whole term yet failed to complete it, this will trigger an immediate overpayment request. Money paid towards periods that were completed, (where you were engaged on the course), will not be demanded from you in this way and will fall under the normal repayment terms, linked to income. The NHS pay my living costs. Will they also make a request for money back if I withdraw mid-year? Yes, once the NHS learn of your withdrawal, they too will review your entitlements and request any overpayment to be repaid. I have spent all the money. What should I do if they ask for some money back? Once you have received the overpayment notice, your options will be explained. You can usually either: Pay back the full amount immediatelyAgree an instalment plan to pay back what you can afford and review it as your circumstances change. Find out more information by visiting Student finance if you suspend or leave your course. I have been awarded a scholarship/bursary. What happens with that funding? In this situation, it is important to check whether there are implications for withdrawing early. The King\u2019s Living Bursary is not recalculated but that may not be the case for other sources of funding, so please refer to any written terms and conditions governing the payment. You might also like to speak to your personal tutor or course administrator about funding implications if the payment has been organised through King\u2019s. What affect will a withdrawal have on funding for any future studies? Can I be funded again if I enrol on to a new course in the future? Many students successfully return to higher education without any funding problems, but this is not always the case. Current regulations tightly control how many times a fee loan can be paid by Student Finance (not maintenance loans) so, on occasion, students can be denied fee loans if they re-enrol on a new course. Therefore, it is recommended that you seek advice before leaving King\u2019s. What financial support can I expect from my funding body? At the start of your higher education journey, once general eligibility has been established, a student can expect fee loans for the duration of a course plus one extra year. This is known as the \u2018standard entitlement\u2019 for fees. The extra year is sometimes called a \u2018gift year\u2019 or \u2018+1\u2019 and every time a student enrols on a year of higher education, they use up one year of their standard entitlement. Given this, access to fee loans can run out or be reduced. It is a complicated area, which is why we strongly recommend speaking to the\u00a0Money & Housing Advice team\u00a0before committing to a withdrawal. What happens if I enrol elsewhere but learn that I have exceeded the \u2018standard entitlement'? Your funding body will carry out a calculation to determine if and when fee loans can be awarded again. If you are ineligible for a fee loan this payment will be blocked but you should still be assessed for maintenance support, which usually includes maintenance loans, parent-related grants and Disabled Student Allowances. Where fee loans are blocked, you will be held personally liable for any tuition fee charged and this will happen at the start of the new course, not the end. I had to withdraw for reasons outside of my control. Why should I be penalised and lose fee loans? In certain situations, if you can show \u2018compelling personal reasons\u2019 (CPR) for not completing a year of study/course, you may be able to rely on discretionary rules to access extra fee loans beyond the \u2018Standard Entitlement\u2019. CPRs are not defined by regulation but typically includes periods where serious ill health has negatively impacted on study or perhaps, a close bereavement. In instances like these, letting your funding body know and providing evidence can help to improve your fee loan entitlements.

This guidance relates to both postgraduate taught and postgraduate research programmes and outlines the financial and practical consequences of withdrawing from your studies. Students withdraw for a myriad of reasons. For example, you may not have settled in London or simply realise you have chosen the wrong course and want to pursue an alternative. To ensure that withdrawal is a suitable option for you and that you are fully aware of the impact this may have on funding, housing and future study, it is strongly advised that you discuss your case with both your personal tutor or supervisor, and Advice Services before making your final decision. We have lots of information and advice about Who to talk\u00a0to in our article I'm not sure if I should leave my course or just take a break.Important to know: If you are studying on a Student Visa, please refer to our guidance on Visa implications\u00a0and sure to consult with Visa & International Adviser before making your decision.In this article we address the considerations you need to think about before submitting a withdrawal request: Key considerations when withdrawingFees & funding when withdrawing Key considerations when withdrawing What will happen with my fees and funding?

What will happen about my housing? If you are living in King\u2019s accommodation, once you stop studying, you will need to find alternative housing as Halls are exclusively for students. Please speak with the King\u2019s Residences about organising an early release from the contract. They will be able to advise further about moving out dates and how the early release impacts on the rental charges. If you live in private halls or at a private rented property, then you should check your contract for terms and conditions. It may be that you are unable to break the lease early, even though you are withdrawing from the course. Speak to Money & Housing Advice if you need further support with this.

Fees & funding when withdrawing If I withdraw before the end of the academic year, will I still pay the full tuition fee? Once your withdrawal is finalised by Student Records, the amount charged will be reviewed to ensure it reflects your period of enrolment. The longer you have been enrolled, the more you can expect to pay and vice-versa. In exceptional circumstances, where there has been a delay in submitting your withdrawal due to unforeseen circumstances, such as ill health, it is worth discussing this with your department, as this may help to reduce the final charge. Are there any exceptions to this fee charging policy? Yes, there are some courses where the charging arrangements differ.

They will also advise Credit Control (Finance) who will update your charge, if necessary. At that point, if you have overpaid, you should request a refund via Student Records. Please also remember, if you have paid a non-refundable deposit, this could cancel out a refund, depending on the figures. For more information visit Student Fee Payments. I used a Postgraduate Loan to pay my tuition fees. Will this money still be refunded back to me? Postgraduate Loans are paid directly to students and are intended as a contribution towards postgraduate study. You can choose how you spend that loan and therefore, if you used it towards your fees, then yes, any overpaid amount will be refunded back to you. If I leave early, do I have to repay the Postgraduate Loan back to my funding body? If you have accessed a Postgraduate Loan and leave before the end of the course, King\u2019s has a duty to inform your funding body of this change. This is because instalments paid are linked to attendance so, in some cases you may find an overpayment is identified once your last day of attendance is confirmed to them. Your funding body will write to you about this and explain your options for settling this bill. I thought my loans were only repayable once I started working and earning over the \u00a321k threshold? To a large degree, this is true. However, the Postgraduate Loan is usually paid in 3 instalments and their release is dependent upon attendance each term. So on occasion, where an instalment is paid (assuming attendance) but later the funding body learn of an earlier withdrawal, an overpayment notice may be sent out to cover the instalment paid in error. You can help avoid this by contacting your funding body as early as possible, to update them on your change of registration. I have spent all the money. What should I do if they ask for some money back? Once you have received the overpayment notice, your options will be explained. You can usually either: Pay back the full amount immediately Agree an instalment plan to pay back what you can afford and review it as your circumstances change. Can you remind me about the repayment arrangements for postgraduate loans? Information on the Postgraduate Masters Loan can be found here at Masters Loan UK government website.For information on the Postgraduate Doctoral Loan visit Doctoral Loan UK government. I have been awarded a scholarship/bursary. What happens with that funding upon my withdrawal? If you have been awarded a scholarship or bursary, it is important to check whether there are implications when withdrawing early. If you have been given written terms and conditions governing the payment, then refer to those for guidance. You might also like to speak to your personal tutor, supervisor or programme administrator who should also be able to guide you on funding implications if the payment has been organised through King\u2019s. If you are a postgraduate research (PGR) student, you may be best to approach the Centre for Doctoral Studies who may be able to support you. What happens if I need funding for future studies? Can I be funded again if I enrol on to a new postgraduate course in the future? As things stand, the Postgraduate Loan is intended to be accessed just once. So, for many, a second Postgraduate Loan application will be denied. Given restrictions like this, you are strongly encouraged to seek advice about funding implications before committing to a withdrawal in case future plans will be impeded. On occasion, an interruption or transfer may be preferable, to protect funding entitlements.If you are uncertain about how to proceed, we recommend reading I'm not sure if I should leave my course or just take a break. I am withdrawing for reasons outside of my control. Why should I be penalised if I leave my course early? In certain situations, a new application for the Postgraduate Loan will be permitted even if you have accessed all or some of the loan in the past. To qualify you must satisfy your funding body that you had \u2018compelling personal reasons\u2019 (CPR) for the original withdrawal. These are reasons outside of your control and might include (but is not limited to), serious ill health or a close bereavement, all of which negatively impacted on your ability to study/attend on the original course. In these instances, letting your funding body know and providing supporting evidence can help improve your access to a second Postgraduate Loan to fund a brand new eligible course.

This article is for undergraduate and postgraduate taught students. Postgraduate research students should visit How can I submit an academic appeal for a research degree? We understand that your performance in an assessment may have\u00a0been affected by adverse circumstances. You may want to make an academic appeal for the following reasons: You were unable to submit a mitigating circumstances form at the time of your assessmentYou want to challenge the outcome of a request for mitigating circumstancesYou believe that procedural errors by the university have impacted on your results Important to know: Appeals which are based on a challenge to the academic judgment of the examiners will not be considered. In this article: Grounds for an appealAppealing a mitigating circumstances decisionMaking an appeal Grounds for an appeal As stated within the Academic Regulations, you may appeal on either or both of the following grounds: Where there is evidence that assessment(s) may have been adversely affected by mitigating circumstances which the student was unable, or for valid reasons unwilling, to make known before the original decision was reached. Where there is clear evidence that assessment(s) may have been adversely affected by a significant administrative error on the part of the College or in the conduct of the assessment. You are expected to inform the university of any mitigating circumstances by submitting a Mitigating Circumstances Form (MCF) as soon as possible either before an assessment, or within 7 days of it. If you submit an appeal which involves the retrospective disclosure of mitigating circumstances, you will need to demonstrate why you didn't make a disclosure earlier. Appealing a mitigating circumstances decision If you have submitted a mitigating circumstances form and it is rejected, you can appeal against this decision once your results have been ratified. This can be on either or both of the following grounds: There is new evidence that could not have been, or for good reason was not, made available at the time of the submission of the mitigating circumstances form, and that sufficient evidence remains that your mitigating circumstances warrant further consideration That evidence can be produced of significant procedural error on the part of the university in the consideration of the mitigating circumstances, and that sufficient evidence remains that the original mitigating circumstances warrant further consideration Making an appeal The appeals process involves two stages: Appeals concerning decisions of the Faculty Assessment Board (FAB). This is known as a Stage 1 appeal.Appeals made to Student Conduct & Appeals; this is known as a Stage 2 appeal. You will only need to submit a Stage\u00a02 appeal if you are not satisfied with the outcome of your Stage 1 appeal. Important to know: If the Faculty Assessment Board rules to remove you from your course of study due to lack of academic progress, there is a separate appeals process. For more information, please refer to How can I submit a progression appeal at King's? How do I submit a Stage 1 Appeal? Complete a Stage 1 Academic Appeal Form and\u202finclude any supporting evidence.This must be submitted within 15 working days of the publication of results of the relevant module. Important to know: Appeals received after this deadline will only be accepted at the discretion of Student Conduct & Appeals. If you are submitting your appeal outside of this timeframe, you should provide a reason and evidence to explain why your appeal is late. What happens after I\u2019ve submitted my Stage 1 appeal? Student Conduct & Appeals will process your form. We'll check that it meets the basic grounds for appeal, including that you\u2019ve provided evidence. The Faculty Assessment Board will then review your appeal. This is a team of senior academics who are familiar with your course. It's supported by professional services staff from your faculty and the wider King's community. They'll look at the supporting evidence you provide and decide whether the criteria for an appeal have been met. If your appeal is upheld, the outcome will depend on your circumstances. For example, you could be granted a further resit of an assessment (capped or uncapped at the pass mark depending on how many times you\u2019ve already taken the assessment). This outcome is then shared with Student Conduct & Appeals and relevant administration teams. They'll update your student record and share the outcome with you in due course. Important to know: There are circumstances in which your Stage 1 appeal may be rejected before your appeal is passed on to the Assessment Board for further consideration.\u202fIf this is the case Student Conduct & Appeals will let you know including your right to challenge this decision. When will I be informed of the outcome of my Stage 1 appeal? Student Conduct & Appeals will normally notify you of the outcome of your appeal via email within 30 working days of the publication of results of the assessment(s) to which your appeal relates to. Over the summer period the university receives high numbers of academic appeals so it may not be possible to get back to you within this timeframe. However, we will endeavour to do so as soon as possible and try to ensure you\u2019re not unduly impacted by any delays. We may not be able to respond to emails asking for updates on the progression of an appeal as we will be focusing on dealing with the large volumes which we receive. I\u2019d like to appeal the outcome of my Stage 1 appeal If you would like to appeal the outcome of your Stage 1 appeal, you will need to submit a Stage 2 appeal to the Head of Student Conduct & Appeals. As stated in the Academic Regulations (see regulation 7.25), students may appeal the decision of an Assessment Board on the following grounds: There is new evidence that could not have been, or for good reason was not, made available at the time of the Stage 1 submission and that sufficient evidence remains that the appeal warrants further consideration; and/or\u00a0\u00a0That evidence can be produced of significant procedural error on the part of the university in considering the appeal, and that sufficient evidence remains that the appeal warrants further consideration; and/or\u00a0Giving due consideration to the evidence and representations previously provided, the decision of the Assessment Board was unreasonable. How do I submit a Stage 2 Appeal? To submit a Stage 2 Appeal, you will need to submit a Stage 2 Academic Appeal Form including any supporting evidence within 10 working days of your Stage 1 Appeal outcome email. Appeals received after this deadline will only be accepted at the discretion of Student Conduct & Appeals. For help on supporting evidence, please refer to guidance from KCLSU Advice on Complaints & Misconduct. What happens after I submit my Stage 2 appeal? Student Conduct & Appeals will determine whether the criteria for an appeal have been met. Where they have determined that an appeal should be heard, an Appeal Committee will be arranged in accordance with the Appeal Committee structure, detailed in the Academic Regulations (see Appendix A). However, if the criteria for an appeal have not been met, your appeal will be dismissed and you will receive a letter outlining the reasons for the decision, and the next steps. When will I be informed of the decision made on my Stage 2\u00a0appeal? You will normally be informed of the decision made on your appeal within 30 working days of the receipt of the Stage 2 Appeal. What happens if an Appeal Committee has been convened? Where an Appeal Committee is convened, you will receive at least 10 working days' notice of the hearing. You will be invited to present your case to the panel. The Chair of the Faculty Assessment Board (FAB) (or nominee) is normally invited to respond to your case. What happens during a Committee hearing? During the Committee hearing, the Committee will determine whether there is sufficient reason to challenge the decision of the Faculty Assessment Board (FAB). Where appropriate, it can set aside the original decision and replace it with one of its own, or refer the case back to the Faculty Assessment Board (FAB) with commentary, for re-consideration. The decision of the Committee will be normally communicated to you and the Chair of the FAB within 5 working days of the decision.\u00a0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b What can I do if I am dissatisfied with the outcome of my Stage 2\u00a0Appeal? When all internal procedures are complete, you may request an independent review of your case by the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education, should you be dissatisfied by the university\u2019s final outcome. The Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education (OIA) is an independent body set up to review student complaints. It is free for students and deals with individual complaints against Higher Education Institutions in England and Wales. Provided your complaint is eligible under the rules of the OIA\u2019s complaints scheme, the OIA will look at whether King's has applied its regulations properly and followed its procedures correctly. It also considers whether any decision made by the King's was fair and reasonable in all circumstances. Who can support me throughout the appeals process? KCLSU Advice are highly experienced in advising students before and during the appeals process. They can accompany and/or represent you during a committee hearing. Student Conduct & Appeals can provide you with further advice on university regulations.\u00a0Your Personal Tutor can also provide you with support during your appeal and throughout your studies.

What is academic misconduct? The university takes examination and assessment offences very seriously, and sets out the procedures for dealing with any such allegations in the King's Academic Manual, the Academic Misconduct Policy and the Academic Misconduct Procedures. Academic Misconduct is the adoption of working methods that are outside the spirit of King's regulations and the values of academic integrity and any actions which interfere with the integrity and rigour of assessment undermine the University\u2019s reputation and education standards. The Academic Misconduct Policy provides extensive information on what constitutes academic misconduct and provides detailed guidance on the use of proofreading services and writing technologies like generative AI.\u00a0Students are advised to spend time to familiarise themselves with the policy. What happens with suspected misconduct? Any instances of suspected misconduct will be reported by the relevant staff member(s) to the Student Conduct & Appeals Office. I\u2019m concerned about another student If you see any unfair academic practice or have concerns about potential academic misconduct committed by another student, please contact\u00a0Student Conduct & Appeals\u00a0and your department in the first instance. \u200b\u200b What is an Academic Integrity Meeting (AIM)? Academic Integrity Meeting is the meeting convened at Stage One of the Academic Misconduct Procedure. Your department will invite you to an AIM if they have concerns about the work you have submitted.AIM is not a hearing. During this meeting, you will be alerted to the problems/concerns identified with the work and will have the opportunity to respond. You will receive further guidance regarding good academic practice, including best practice on referencing or other important academic skills. The department will also discuss with you if there are other academic or non-academic support needs that King's can facilitate to ensure your future works are up to standard and to maximise your academic success. After the meeting you will receive notes of the discussion and a copy of the materials that were discussed in the meeting. If you forgot to mention something in the AIM, or have other information that you want the department to consider before making a decision on your case, you may submit that within 5 working days from the date of which you were sent the meeting notes.\u200b\u200b Can I be accompanied or represented in the AIM? You may be accompanied by: Another King\u2019s community member, including a member/staff of KCLSUFriend or family member Your accompanying person may advise and assist you during the meeting but you are expected to communicate with the department representatives directly.\u00a0The Chair will invite your KCLSU Representative to make representation on your behalf at the end of the meeting. If I don't attend the AIM with my department, what will happen? Academic Integrity Meetings are important academic meetings that you are expected to attend. If you are unable to attend, please inform the the department immediately, outlining the reason(s) why you can't attend. The department will determine whether the meeting can be postponed.Important to know:\u00a0If you are absent from the meeting without permission, your department may proceed in making a decision of your case based on the evidence that they have.\u00a0The outcome is not invalidated due to your unauthorised absence, provided that you have been given timely written notice of the meeting. What are the possible outcomes under Stage One AIM? After the end of the 5-working days, the ASB Chair (or their nominee) will review all information available to them and decide one of the following outcomes: No cause of concern, work will be marked as usualThe concerns relate to poor academic practice but not academic misconduct \u2013 work will be marked in line with the assessment criteriaAcademic misconduct has occurred and an outcome should be applied locallyThe case should be referred to Stage Two for further consideration. What can I do if I am not happy with Stage One (AIM) outcome? You can't contest the Department\u2019s decision to refer your case to Stage Two of the Academic Misconduct Procedure, but you will have further opportunities to present your case at Stage Two. If the department concludes after the AIM Meeting that academic misconduct has occurred and ordered one or more outcomes, you may contest the outcome within 10 working days from the date of the written notification of the Stage One AIM Outcome using the Contestation of Academic Integrity Meeting (AIM) Outcomes form. You should elaborate clearing in the contestation form why you think the case warrants further review and provide supporting evidence of it.

What is \u2018Fitness to Practise\u2019? King\u2019s has a responsibility in respect of students who are following a programme of study leading to a professional qualification which is registerable with a statutory regulatory body.\u00a0You can learn more about this by reading our Fitness to Practise Policy. In addition to obtaining the relevant qualification, we must be satisfied that you would be a safe and suitable entrant to the given profession and are therefore fit for registration and practise. The following programmes of study to which this responsibility applies include: All programmes in Midwifery with registration\u00a0All programmes in Nursing with registration\u00a0BSc Nutrition and Dietetics\u00a0PGDip Dietetics\u00a0MSc Dietetics\u00a0BSc Physiotherapy\u00a0MSc Physiotherapy\u00a0MBBS\u00a0BDS\u00a0BSc Dental Therapy and Hygiene\u00a0MPharm\u00a0DClinPsych Doctorate in Clinical Psychology\u00a0PGCE Postgraduate Certificate in Education\u00a0PCE Professional Graduate Certificate in EducationFoundation Year One Training. The university is responsible for ensuring that MBBS graduates of the university during their Foundation Year One training follow an approved training programme and certify successful completion of this programme. This certification entitles full registration with the General Medical Council. For the purpose of this Policy, the term \u2018student\u2019 shall include Foundation Year One students, and the term \u2018programme of study\u2019 shall include the Foundation Year One training. What happens if my faculty have concerns about my fitness to practise? The faculty will investigate any concerns about a student\u2019s Fitness for Registration and to Practise and will make one of the following decisions: Permit you to continue with the course as there is no case to answer;\u00a0Permit you to continue with the course with no further action;\u00a0Permit you to continue with the course with enhanced supervision, support and/or monitoring or remediation which could include a period of interruption and a review before returning;\u00a0Refer you to a university Fitness to Practise Committee. How/why would I be referred to a Fitness to Practise Committee? At King\u2019s, there are two possible routes of referral to a university level \u2018Fitness to Practise Committee\u2019: Misconduct: Where a charge of misconduct is upheld in accordance with the Academic Regulations, the faculty/institute/school may refer the case for consideration by a Fitness to Practise Committee, if they deem this necessary.Other matters which justify referral: Where you demonstrate behaviour and/or health issues which do not constitute misconduct, but which raise concerns for your fitness for registration or practice. The faculty/institute/school will investigate the matter and decide whether the case should be referred for consideration by a Fitness to Practise Committee. Important to know: Where the alleged misconduct could also constitute an offence under the criminal law, the university's procedures may be delayed until the police and/or courts have completed their investigations and proceedings. I have been told my case is going to a Fitness to Practise Committee; what does this mean? If your case has been referred to a Fitness to Practise Committee for consideration, this means that your faculty has concerns that you may not be fit for registration and practise. If your case is going to a Fitness to Practise Committee, you will receive information regarding the Committee date and relevant documentation from Student Conduct & Appeals at least 10 working days\u2019 before the Hearing. What can I expect at a Fitness to Practice Committee Hearing? \u200bWhen a Fitness to Practise Committee is convened, you will be notified of this, at least 10 working days\u2019 in advance via email. Alongside the email, you will receive access to the relevant documentation under consideration and the relevant university regulation. You may submit any additional documentation, evidence, and the names of any witnesses no later than 5 working\u00a0days before your Committee Hearing. The Executive Dean of the Faculty (or nominee) will present the case on behalf of university. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bYou will be given the opportunity to present your response to the Committee, and the Committee will have questions for both you and your Faculty representative. \u200b\u200b Once the Committee have obtained all the information they consider relevant during the Hearing, the Committee will deliberate in private and will determine whether you are fit for registration and practise. If the Committee decide this is not the case, it will either order:\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bThat your registration on the programme be terminated.\u00a0You undergo medical treatment or other appropriate remedial action, during which you may be suspended. There will be an agreed review date where a further determination will be made as to whether you are fit for registration and practise. If the Committee find that you are fit for registration and practise, no further action will be taken. You will find out the outcome of the Committee Hearing within 5 working days.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Can I appeal against the decision of a Fitness to Practise Committee? If you are unhappy with the decision made by the Fitness to Practise Committee, you may submit an appeal to Student Conduct & Appeals. This must be made within 10 working days of the written notification of the Fitness to Practise Committee's decision. How can I submit an appeal? You should complete a Fitness to Practise Appeal Form and email the form to Student Conduct & Appeals, within 10 working days of the written notification of the Fitness to Practise Committee's decision. On what grounds will my appeal be considered?

If the Principal concludes that your appeal does not meet any of the grounds, your appeal will be dismissed. When will I find out the outcome of my appeal? You will be informed of the decision made on your outcome within 30 working days of receipt of the appeal.\u00a0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b What happens if an Appeal Committee is convened? Where an Appeal Committee is convened, you will normally receive at least 10 working days' notice of the Hearing date, alongside the relevant documentation under consideration. You will be invited to present your case to the Committee, and a faculty representative will also be invited to attend. What happens during an Appeal Committee Hearing? \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bDuring the Committee Hearing, the Committee will determine whether there is sufficient reason to challenge the decision made by the original Fitness to Practise Committee; where it concludes such reason is present, they can either:\u00a0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b \u200b\u200b\u200bModify or reverse the findings or order(s) of the Fitness to Practise Committee.Order that the previous decision be set aside, and the case be reheard by a fresh Fitness to Practise Committee. When will I know the outcome of the Appeal Committee hearing? The decision of the Committee will normally be communicated to you and the Faculty representative within 5 working days of the Committee Hearing. What can I do if I\u2019m unhappy with the outcome of my appeal? When all internal procedures are complete, you may request an independent review of your case by the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education, should you be dissatisfied by the College\u2019s final outcome. The Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education (OIA) is an independent body set up to review student complaints. It is free for students and deals with individual complaints against Higher Education Institutions in England and Wales. Provided your complaint is eligible under the rules of the OIA's complaints scheme, the OIA will look at whether King's has applied its regulations properly and followed its procedures correctly. It also considers whether any decision made by King's was fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Rate this article \u00a0\u2605 Need support?

In this article: What the Support for Study Policy & Procedure is and how it worksSupport for students going through Support for StudyFurther Questions about Support for Study What the Support for Study policy & procedure is and how it works What is the Support for Study policy & procedure? The Support for Study Policy & Procedure is a three-stage process we use to support you if we have concerns about your health and academic engagement. For example, we would be worried if your health, appearance and/or attitude had significantly deteriorated. Similarly, we\u2019d be concerned if you were unable to attend classes, meet deadlines, progress academically or participate in student life. We use the Support for Study Policy & Procedure to ensure you can access relevant support and information from your faculty, our Student Support Services and the wider King\u2019s community. This process also helps university staff make fair and informed decisions about how best to support students who are struggling. What happens at each stage of the Support for Study process? You\u2019ll be emailed an invitation to a Support for Study meeting. Usually, you'll be told who you will be meeting with, as well as their roles, the concerns that have been raised and the options for support which will be discussed. If you have any queries about this, please do email the staff member who has contacted you. There are three stages to the Support for Study process. Depending on your needs and the issues you\u2019re facing, we might move you through each stage in sequence, or we might place you directly into Stage 2 or 3. Stage 1 A Stage 1 meeting takes place between you and a member of your faculty staff, usually your personal tutor or supervisor. They\u2019ll call the meeting if you disclose mild to moderate concerns about your wellbeing, for example if you\u2019re struggling to adjust to student life, feel isolated or don't know how to improve your circumstances. Alternatively, members of staff in your the faculty may call a Stage 1 meeting if they have mild concerns about your engagement with your studies and/or life at King\u2019s. What happens at a Support for Study Stage 1 meeting? Your personal tutor or supervisor will discuss with you the support you may already have in place and signpost you to relevant support services within King\u2019s. They\u2019ll also discuss options around your academic studies such as: Alternative study options, such as going part time;A break from your studies;Signposting you to ask for extensions or deferrals or academic appeals through the relevant processes;A transfer to another programme within King\u2019s or external to King\u2019s;A potential withdrawal from the university. They will agree an action plan with you and, if appropriate, review it with you later. Stage 2 A Stage 2 meeting takes place between you and the senior member of staff within your department or faculty. Sometimes members of the university support service may attend, such as Faculty Wellbeing Advisers. A Stage 2 meeting may be called if: Staff have moderate or serious concerns about your wellbeing, for example if you\u2019ve lost your accommodation and are falling behind as a result.Staff have concerns that your behaviour is having a detrimental impact on the King\u2019s community. What happens at a Support for Study Stage 2 meeting? Your personal tutor or supervisor will discuss with you the support you may already have in place and, where appropriate, refer you to a relevant support service at King's. A member of staff from Student Services might also join to help with the discussion about what support is available to you. They\u2019ll also discuss options around your academic studies, such as: Alternative study options, such as going part time;A break from studies;Signposting you to ask for extensions, deferrals or academic appeals through the relevant processes;\u00a0A transfer to another programme within King\u2019s or externally;A potential\u00a0withdrawal from the university. Important to know:\u00a0At this Stage it is more likely that staff will refer you to a support service rather than signpost you. This means that, rather than giving you the information to contact another service, the staff member will contact them on your behalf. Stage 3 Stage 3 of the Support for Study Policy & Procedure is for very serious concerns, where continuing to study may put you or others at risk of serious harm. For example: Staff may call a Stage 3 meeting if they are concerned that continuing to study may pose a serious threat to your mental health. This could include a situation where studying is highly likely to interfere with the treatment or management of a severe mental health condition.If your behaviour is having a seriously detrimental impact on the King\u2019s community, you could also be asked to attend a Stage 3 meeting. Who will be present at a Support for Study Stage 3 meeting? A Stage 3 meeting takes place between you and a panel of senior staff. As well as relevant people from your faculty, you\u2019ll be supported by professional services staff and representatives from King\u2019s support services including the Counselling & Mental Health Service. Members of the Student Conduct & Appeals team will also be there to give advice and support about the process itself. What happens at a Support for Study Stage 3 meeting? You\u2019ll discuss the same options as under Stage 1 and Stage 2. Normally the meeting will be structured as follows (however this may vary with each individual case): Introduction to the meeting Your faculty will discuss how they have been supporting you in your studies and their concerns about your health and wellbeing University support staff will discuss their concerns and any previous interactions they've had with you You\u2019ll be given the opportunity to discuss your position and the support which you may require A discussion between the university support staff, academic staff and you about how best to support you including the options Outcome and conclusion with any follow up actions agreed Important to know: The structure of the meeting may vary slightly with each individual case. What happens if I don\u2019t want to go to my Stage 3 Support for Study meeting? We recommend that you attend if at all possible. The purpose of the meeting is to support you, and attending means you\u2019re able to ask questions directly and let university staff know your preferred outcomes.\u00a0We aim to address all\u00a0issues that need to be raised as sensitively as possible. If you\u2019re nervous about attending, we\u2019re happy for you to bring someone to support you. This could be a family member, a friend or a KCLSU Advice Caseworker who can represent you. If you decide not to attend your review meeting, we can consider a written statement from you instead. What happens when I receive my Stage 3 outcome? You\u2019ll learn what decision was made about your studies from your Stage 3 outcome. It may include recommendations or conditions for your continued study or return to study following a mandatory interruption. Recommendations are suggestions from the panel about the support they think would best help you. You\u2019re not required to fulfil them to continue or return to study. Conditions are requirements from the panel about the support and/or actions you must take. You have to meet them in order to continue or return to study. If you\u2019re\u00a0unsure what your outcome means, please contact the Support for Study team who will liaise with your Faculty and other relevant staff. Taking a break or 'interruption' in your studies An interruption is a temporary break in your studies, usually until the next academic year. If all other support options have been exhausted, staff may decide it\u2019s in your best interest to interrupt you for a period of time. They will only do this if they have very serious concerns that they don\u2019t believe can be addressed through the support structures you currently have in place, both at King\u2019s and externally. We will interrupt you only if we believe it would be detrimental to you and/or other members of the King\u2019s community if you were to continue studying. In certain circumstances, you may appeal a decision to interrupt you from your studies under the Support for Study process. To learn how to do this, please read our article How can I appeal the outcome of my Stage 3 Support for Study meeting?\u00a0\u00a0\u200b\u200b\u200b Withdrawing from your studies In very exceptional circumstances the panel may decide to withdraw a student from study at King\u2019s. This will only happen where all other options have been exhausted, including interruption, or where an independent medical professional recommends it as in the student\u2019s best interests. In certain circumstances, you may appeal a decision to withdraw you from your studies under the Support for Study process. To learn how to do this, please read our article How can I appeal the outcome of my Stage 3 Support for Study meeting? When and why might my case be escalated to the next stage of Support for Study? Cases are escalated under Support for Study in the following circumstances: You're unable or unwilling to engage with the process.Concerns have escalated about your wellbeing and/or the impact of your behaviour on the King\u2019s community. For example, if concerns about your mental health move from mild to serious, we would move you from Stage 1 to 2. Important to know: If there are very serious concerns about your health and wellbeing, we might place you in Stage 2 immediately. Support for students going through Support for Study What support will I receive under the Support for Study Policy & Procedure? The types of support will vary with each individual situation.\u00a0We\u2019ll consider what support you already have in place externally and/or within King\u2019s.\u00a0If we think you might benefit from internal or external support, we might signpost or refer you to one or more of our student support services.

You could also think about what actions (if any) you want to take and what actions (if any) you want the university to take. For Stage 3 meetings, you may also be asked to submit evidence. For details of evidence, please see I've been asked to submit evidence for Support for Study, what do I do? What reasonable adjustments can I request?

Reasonable adjustments can be discussed with Disability Support & Inclusion, who will then recommend them to the Student Conduct & Appeals team. Any requests will be considered in line with the Support for Study Policy to check whether they can be accommodated. Will my parents/guardians/next of kin be contacted about my Support for Study meeting? Normally, we won\u2019t contact your parents/guardians/next of kin about your Support for Study meeting unless you ask us to.\u00a0However, in exceptional circumstances where there are serious safeguarding concerns, we may decide to contact them without consulting you.

The support they give you will be tailored to your needs. It could involve: Check-ins with a Student Welfare Advisor or Wellbeing Advisor Help with accessing support from NHS and other external services\u00a0\u200b\u200b Further Questions about Support for Study Will the Support for Study process be used if I am hospitalised? If you're taken into hospital for in-patient treatment, the university will consider how to support you very carefully. In some circumstances, you might need to take\u00a0a short break from your studies. If this is the case, we\u2019ll use other processes such as Mitigating Circumstances. If you\u2019re experiencing severe health concerns, including treatment requiring a stay in hospital for a period of three days or more, the university will interrupt you until such time as you\u2019re deemed to have capacity to study by an independent medical professional. How does Support for Study relate to other King\u2019s policies and procedures? What is the difference between Support for Study and Fitness to Practise? Support for Study is for all students at King\u2019s. It\u2019s a process to help support you engage with your studies when your health or wellbeing may be affecting them. Fitness to Practise only applies to students who are on certain professional courses. It relates to health, professionalism and behaviour that may affect your ability to practise your profession, including your attendance on placements. What is the relationship between Support for Study and other King's processes? Support for Study may be used in conjunction with other processes such as Student of Concern, Prolonged Lack of Contact and Failure to make Sufficient Academic Progress. The different circumstances of each case will determine which are the appropriate processes to support you and your situation. Support for Study is intended to be used where there\u2019s a medium to long term situation in relation to your health, whereas the Student of Concern process is intended to deal with short term serious concerns. Our Prolonged Lack of Contact process may be used if you've not engaged with the university for some time: we want to establish what is happening for you. If we have welfare concerns, then the Student of Concern and/or the Support for Study processes will be used to help you. The Failure to Make Academic Progress policy may be used if you\u2019re not keeping up with your course. If we have welfare concerns following this process then the Student of Concern and/or Support for Study processes will be used to support you.

Depending on how your course is assessed, you can be examined in one of three ways at King\u2019s: Open book examinations An open book exam will allow you to bring written or printed material, such as a textbook (with highlights) or written notes into the exam venue. Limited book examinations A limited book exam is an exam where you can bring texts into the exam that have been approved by your module leader. You will be told in advance the name of the text(s) you can bring into the exam and they will be listed at the front of your exam paper. Any text brought into a limited book exam cannot have any written notes inside them or contain any other pieces of paper. However, key words or phrases can be highlighted within the text. The texts will be checked during the exam and will be taken away if they do not meet the guidelines above. Students found to have brought in texts that contain additional notes or marking will be reported to the Student Conduct, Complaints and Appeals Office. Closed book examinations In a closed book exam, you are not allowed to bring any written material into the exam hall. The majority of exams taken at King\u2019s are closed book.

Will there be a\u00a0maximum word limit\u00a0for my remote online exam? Your faculty will confirm whether: There is a maximum word limit on your online exam for the whole exam or per question.What the word limit\u00a0will be, and\u00a0what it will/will not include.If any penalties are in place for exceeding word counts.

You are expected to: Undertake your exam on your own without any assistance.Not collaborate or discuss your answers or any information about the online exam with anyone else (this includes sharing answers on social media). Not act or use any such information received from another student. As with coursework assignments, normal processes (e.g. Turnitin) will be used to check that submissions do not draw from your own or other people\u2019s work in an inappropriate way, and you will be required to confirm that the submission is your own work. If staff have reason to think that you have collaborated with other students, this will be treated as Academic Misconduct. Important to know: There is further information on KEATS about\u00a0Academic Integrity & Avoiding Plagiarism. You can also attend a workshop, which you can enrol\u00a0on via King's Academic Skills for Learning.Before sitting an exam at King's, please refer to the university\u2019s Academic Honesty & Integrity Policy and the Misconduct Policy Procedure. Can I contact my faculty for support with my answers or to clarify my interpretation of the questions I am being asked? Remote online exams are not coursework assignments\u00a0so you need to interpret what is being asked of you independently and plan and write your answers entirely yourself. Faculty staff will not be able to respond to direct questions about the online exam questions once the assessment is underway. What should I do if I notice a mistake on my remote online exam paper? If you identify a mistake in your remote online exam paper once released, please report this to your faculty/department\u00a0in the first instance. Please be advised no amendments or clarifications will be made during the online exam and you are instructed to complete the question as much as you are able to with the information provided. IT/Technical support during your remote online exam Difficulties completing a remote online exam remotely due to IT issues We know that some students might\u00a0have difficulty completing a remote online exam remotely\u00a0due to having limited access to a computer or an unreliable internet connection for downloading the online exam paper or for uploading their answers. If you think your internet connection is not reliable enough to download papers or upload your answers, please contact your department/faculty\u00a0as soon as possible if this is likely to be the case. Technical issues on the day of your\u00a0examIf you experience any technical issues with your online exam, for example\u00a0accessing or uploading your\u00a0online exam, then contact IT Services in the first instance.\u00a0The Service Desk is available 24/7 and can be contacted by: Emailing\u00a0IT\u00a0directlyCalling the IT\u00a0Service Desk on 020 7848 8888 If your online exam cannot be completed or submitted due to technical issues, contact your department/faculty for further guidance. After speaking with a member of staff, you might\u00a0be advised to submit\u00a0mitigating circumstances. What happens in the event of a technical failure of university systems? You should first confirm that the problem is not with the computer or internet connection you are using.\u00a0If the university\u2019s electronic submission system suffers a technical fault, you will normally be contacted by your department/faculty, but if you become aware of a technical issue during an online exam you should alert a member of staff as soon as it is possible to do so. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Submitting your remote online exam Before submitting your remote online exam, you should: Make sure you know where your online exam can be found and how long you have to complete it.Ensure that your online exam is in the correct format, as specified in the instructions.Make sure you submit the correct file(s). You can check this by opening the file and proof-reading it just before sending. The last submission you make before the deadline will be the one\u00a0that is marked. \u00a0 \u00a0If you have multiple handwritten files, you can convert photos of your work to one PDF file using a scanning app such as CamScanner.If you are submitting a zipped file, make sure that you have attached all the files that are required for the assignment. Keep a copy of your receipt for the submission. When submitting your remote online exam please remember that: You are responsible for ensuring that the correct work is submitted.\u00a0The file(s) electronically submitted by you at the time of the deadline will be taken as the final and complete submitted work, and no amendments or additions will be allowed after the submission deadline.\u00a0 Please ensure you have uploaded all of your answers and not a partially completed online exam answer file. You are responsible for ensuring that submitted electronic files are submitted in one of the specified acceptable file formats, and not corrupted.\u00a0You should check files on the system after submission to ensure they are valid and correct.You must ensure that any instructions for submission are followed.\u00a0Failure to correctly follow instructions given on your remote online exam paper may result in work not being marked. Technical failure, including of a computer, browser or internet connection, is not a valid reason for late submission of work, unless as a result of a failure of the university\u2019s IT systems, and in the case that there was no reasonable course of action you could have taken to submit the work on time. Evidence is likely to be needed to support any technical failures which prevented the submission of an online exam by the specified time. Take a look at our article about mitigating circumstances evidence. It is important that you do not leave your submission to the last minute.\u00a0During university submission deadlines, both KEATS and Turnitin can run slower than normal due to the high demand placed on the software. Leaving your submission to the last moment could result in your work being marked as a late submission by the system and being given a mark of zero. What if I submit my completed online exam after the deadline? You will find specific instructions for submission on the relevant KEATS page of the online exam for which you are submitting work. You have up until the specified deadline to submit your online exam.\u00a0KEATS automatically notifies submissions received on or after this\u00a0as late,\u00a0so you need to submit before the deadline. Online exams submitted after the deadline will receive a mark of zero and noted as a fail unless a Mitigating Circumstances Form\u00a0has been submitted\u00a0in advance of the online exam. No feedback or indicative grade will be provided. Further support when taking your remote online exam What can I do if I am ill before or during a remote\u00a0online exam? If you become unwell before or during a remote online exam, you may\u00a0need to apply for\u00a0mitigating circumstances. Take a look at our article What are mitigating circumstances?\u00a0for more guidance on this. What should I do if I am unable to take my online exam? If due to exceptional circumstances you are not able to take an\u00a0online exam, you may\u00a0be able to apply for mitigating circumstances.\u00a0Please\u00a0speak to your department/faculty before making a submission and take a look at our article Evidence to support your mitigating circumstances application.

Ramadan involves a daily period of fasting for Muslims starting at dawn and finishing at sunset for the whole month. This means abstaining from food, drink (including water), and smoking. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Observing Ramadan during your assessments Accessing Prayer Rooms at King's We have a dedicated prayer room at each of our campuses.

Preparing for online assessments if you have Personalised Assessment Arrangements Will I receive additional time for online assessments? If you are granted PAA, the format of the online exam you are taking will determine if additional time will be included for your assessment: For online exams taken over a 24-hour period where you can submit your assessment at any time within the 24 hours provided, no additional time will be awarded. The expectation is that such assessments will take approximately the same length of time as a traditional exam, and thus the 24-hour time period allows for any extra time or rest breaks you would have taken in an invigilated exam on campus. For online exams where you will have 24 hours within which you may open your assessment at any point and once the assessment has been opened, becomes timed and you have an allocated amount of time to complete the assessment, additional time will be awarded. For online exams with a fixed duration (e.g. 2-4 hours), if your PAA includes additional time then this will be added. Additional time may also be included for online exam paper download and collation/upload periods. Can I use my neurodiversity assessment coversheet for online assessments? If you have a neurodiversity assessment coversheet as part of your PAA provisions, then you should attach this to the first page of your document. What arrangements are made for students with PAA? Below are some examples of arrangements that we grant for certain Specific Learning Difficulties (SpLDs) and medical conditions at King\u2019s. Important to know: If you have multiple conditions, then the arrangements listed below will not be combined.

You can only request one 7-day extension per assessment. There's no restriction on requesting 7-day extensions for different coursework assessments. If you request a 7-day extension and find that you need more than the 7 additional days, you\u2019ll need to submit another Mitigating Circumstances form, and select\u00a0another category. You'll need to provide an explanation of your circumstances and supporting evidence. Important to know:\u00a0Some academic departments may offer you a short extension that is longer than\u00a0the approved\u00a0seven days.\u00a0This may be for administrative reasons, or to keep within their assessment cycles, but you are able to hand in your work at any point during the agreed extension time.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b If 7-day extensions can only be applied to assessments where completion time/deadlines are set at least three weeks in advance, what about other assessments with shorter timings? Extra time is available for timed tests and examinations, but assessments with short time frames (including 24-hour online examinations) usually have additional time built in, so that it is not necessary to add any further time for disabled students.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Can I request a 7-day extension for a dissertation? Yes, you\u00a0are able to\u00a0request a\u00a07-day\u00a0extension for a dissertation. Can I request a 7-day extension for a presentation? This would not normally be appropriate, but if you are required to submit your presentation in a written format then you can request a 7-day extension for it. Important to know:\u00a0Verbal presentation deadlines can't be extended under this arrangement. You should speak to your personal tutor\u00a0if you will not be able to present at the time given. To find out how to contact your personal tutor, read our article Who is my personal tutor & what do they do? My tutor has set a task to complete for next week and won\u2019t provide an extension, why is this? Assessments with short time frames (see above) are not covered by the 7-day extension arrangement. Assessments with short time frames are set with enough time for all students to complete them, including those who need extra time compared to others.\u00a0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Keywords: adjustments coursework essays dissertations Related Articles (3) After you have submitted your Personalised Assessment Arrangements (PAA) application Guidance for applying for Personalised Assessment Arrangements (PAA) What are Personalised Assessment Arrangements (PAA)?

This is a read only version of the page. Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01037 Print What are mitigating circumstances? We know that there are times when unexpected circumstances occur, such as an illness, bereavement or difficult family circumstances, which can affect your ability to study or complete an assessment. We call situations like these a mitigating circumstance.Mitigating circumstances are defined in academic regulation 4.24: \u201cThe university defines mitigating circumstances as recognisably disruptive or unexpected events beyond the student\u2019s control that might have a significant and adverse impact on their academic performance. The Mitigating Circumstances Policy applies to students on taught programmes. Marks will never be raised due to mitigating circumstances.\u201d Prospective student & mitigating circumstances Please visit our Study at King's webpages for the latest guidance on mitigating circumstances for Undergraduate and Postgraduate\u00a0students. Current students & mitigating circumstances For current students, mitigating circumstances might: Affect your ability to study for, prepare and submit an assessed piece of work by a set deadline. Affect your ability to attend an exam, class or lab assessment on a date set by your department. By submitting a Mitigating Circumstances request you can make your circumstances known to your Assessment Sub Board. The outcome of a successful application might result in an extension to a coursework submission deadline or grant you an authorised absence from an exam. What is the difference between Mitigating Circumstances & Personalised Assessment Arrangements (PAA)? The key difference between mitigating circumstances and Personalised Assessment Arrangements (PAA)\u00a0is whether the circumstances affecting your academic performance are predictable and can be anticipated well in advance. Students with a long-term health condition or learning disability are usually able to predict when or how their circumstances will impact their ability to complete assessments. As such, by applying for PAA they can, for example, be granted more time/resources to submit coursework or attend an exam. For more detailed articles about PAA, please visit the Assessment section of Student Services Online and click on the 'Personalised Assessment Arrangements' sub-section. In contrast, when a student experiences an unexpected event that couldn\u2019t have been planned for nor controlled, then they can apply for mitigating circumstances. Our article Evidence to support your mitigating circumstances application provides a list of example situations that would typically be considered acceptable mitigating circumstances. The examples are not exhaustive, however, and the university will assess each request individually to account for the specific circumstances (or combination of them) and the evidence provided.

Of course, we strongly encourage you to think about how ready you are for an assessment well in advance. This way, you can take proactive steps if you think your circumstances might have a negative impact on your academic performance.Once you know your application deadline(s), to learn how to submit a mitigating circumstances request, read our article How can I apply for mitigating circumstances?This article covers the different submission deadlines for mitigating circumstances: Before a deadline or exam dateAfter a deadline or exam dateAfter resultsEvidence deadlineIf you miss the request submission and/or evidence deadlineRetrospective casesExceptional casesUrgent applications Before a deadline or exam dateYou can submit a request at any time before a deadline or exam date. After a deadline or exam dateYou can submit a request no later than 7 calendar days after a deadline or exam date. After resultsMitigating circumstances requests will not be accepted after the publication of results. Evidence deadlineAll evidence that supports your mitigating circumstance application must be received within 21 calendar days (14 calendar days for King's Online programmes) of your deadline or exam date. This means that you can submit your request (according to the timescales outlined above) but have slightly longer to provide evidence. If you miss the request submission and/or evidence deadlineNormally, your request will be rejected. However, if you can meet the normal evidence requirements and evidence why you were unable to adhere to the deadline, your request will be considered. Retrospective casesIf you attempted an assessment but in retrospect realise your academic performance might have been impacted by a mitigating circumstance, you can submit a request no later than 7 calendar days after a deadline or exam date.In addition to normal evidence requirements, you\u2019ll need to evidence why your judgement to attempt the assessment was impaired. Exceptional casesThe default position for mitigating circumstances is that evidence must be submitted to support your claim. However, the university acknowledges that in exceptional cases, it might be impossible to obtain evidence and in such cases the requirement to submit evidence will be waived. Examples of exceptional cases include, but are not limited to: Gender violence and abuseCoercive relationshipsStudents impacted by political unrest/conflictStudents estranged from parents/partner (financial/emotional impact) Urgent applicationsSometimes a situation might arise where you need to submit mitigating circumstances request urgently. For example, the circumstances occur on the day of a deadline or exam.In these cases, the application process is no different to that if your circumstances occurred well in advance of an assessment. You should: Submit a mitigating circumstances request as soon as possible. Remember, you don\u2019t need to wait until you have evidence.Gather the evidence required for your circumstance as soon as you\u2019re able. You have 21 calendar days (14 calendar days for King's Online programmes) from the date of your assessment to submit your evidence. When assessing your application, it will be obvious to the assessor from the dates of your evidence why you could not submit your request more in advance.

What information should I include in my narrative about my circumstances? The information you provide in your supporting narrative is used to inform an administrative decision about whether to award you an extension or deferral. You should focus on outlining your circumstances, the impact that these would have/have had on your affected assessment(s), and the dates concerned. There\u2019s no need to include graphic accounts of challenges or issues that you\u2019ve experienced, though we invite you to register with King\u2019s Student Services if you\u2019d like to receive support around those issues, from specialist practitioners.

Information about the source of your translation must also be included. Important to know: Please make sure that all of the files you submit are labelled. If you need a scanner, you can find one in our libraries. Exactly what evidence do I need to provide? The type of evidence you will need to provide depends on your specific circumstances, as follows: Physical ill health Please provide the names of the illness or condition, the impact the illness would have/has had on the affected assessment(s) and the dates concerned. This should be supported by an original medical certificate from an appropriately qualified medical practitioner. Additionally, this also applies to cases of Covid-19. Photos of Covid-19 test results are no longer acceptable as evidence. Medical certificates are acceptable, but photos of medication are not acceptable. However, if the impact on your physical ill health is significant (e.g. requiring multiple assessment adjustments, or delay to your progression), then we may wish to see further evidence, including evidence of in-person medical evaluations. The medical certificate must be dated and apply to the time period that your circumstances were affected. The certificate must also be provided in English or with a translation. Please indicate whether the translation has been done by an individual or online. If you're unable to obtain a medical certificate, ZoomDoc and similar sources are also normally acceptable. If you already have Personalised Assessment Arrangements (PAA) in place, please use the \u201cExtension given by PAA\u201d category. You do not need to provide evidence if you have a PAA. Note: this is just to request a short extension, extensions of longer than one week will require you to submit evidence under a different MCF category (with evidence). Mental ill health Important to know: If you're not already engaged with our Counselling & Mental Health Support Service, please don't register to receive support with your evidence. The service might not be able to meet with you before your evidence deadline, so we recommend you reach out to your doctor or another service who already knows about your mental health difficulties.

Long-term medical condition or disability Please provide a King\u2019s Inclusion Plan (KIP) that confirms the medical condition or disability and explicitly states that the KIP may be used as evidence to support mitigating circumstances. If your KIP explicitly states that it can be used as evidence to support mitigating circumstances, then you can upload it at the \u2018Upload Supporting Evidence\u2019 stage of a new mitigating circumstances request on Student Records. Most KIPs will not have this explicit statement. If your KIP does not, please follow the procedure above for physical or mental ill health.

We have provided some basic instructions on how to check the status of your request below.\u00a0You can also find detailed screenshots on how to check the status of a request from Page 9-10 of the\u00a0Student Guide for Submitting a Mitigating Circumstances request via Student Records PDF (Within Section 6: Checking the status of a submitted request) To check the status of your request: Log on to\u00a0Student Records.Select \u2018Student Home Page\u2019 within the banner at the top of the homepage.Select \u2018My Mitigating Circumstances\u2019 within the \u2018My Modules\u2019 area.On the Mitigating Circumstances homepage, go to the \u2018Requests Under Consideration\u2019 area. Here you will see a list of your requests currently under consideration and the current status/stage of each request. What are the different stages of a mitigating circumstances request? Stage 1: Pre-panel Administration review stage This is the first stage, where your request is initially reviewed by the relevant Professional Services or equivalent administrative team. The request will remain at this stage if further evidence and/or information has been requested. While your request is at this stage, you can upload further evidence/information. Stage 2: Board / Panel review stage Once your request has been initially reviewed at the Pre-panel Administration stage, it will (in most cases) then progress to the Board / Panel stage. You can\u2019t upload evidence while your request is at this stage, but if further evidence and/or information is required then it will return to the Pre-panel Administration stage, where you can. When deciding the outcome of your mitigating circumstance request, the Assessment Sub Board Chair will take into consideration: Whether the mitigating circumstances are significant, including the period of time affected.The number of assessments affected. Within a given module there is a limit to the number of assessments you can miss while still being able to demonstrate that you have achieved the learning outcomes of the module.The authenticity of the evidence provided. Stage 3: Apply Mitigation review stage If your request is approved, it will then progress to the final stage \u2013 Apply Mitigation. This is where the mitigations are applied to the assessments. You will receive an automated outcome email once all the mitigations (relevant to your request) have been applied.\u00a0 You can\u2019t upload any evidence while your request is at this stage. How & when will I be informed of the outcome of my request? The outcome will be sent to your King\u2019s email address, normally within 7 calendar days from the date you submitted your application. The response time\u00a0might be longer during periods when the\u00a0university\u00a0is closed, such as the Christmas and New Year break. For\u00a0information on when the university is closed, please visit our article\u00a0When is the university closed? Important to know: The outcome of your application for mitigating circumstances\u00a0is not recorded on your official transcript or your degree certificate. What happens if my request is approved? If your request is approved, you\u2019ll receive an automated outcome email to your King\u2019s email address once all the mitigation(s) relevant to your request have been applied. The outcome email will include the overall decision and details of the mitigation(s) applied, as well as any individual assessment rejections.One of the following mitigations will be applied to your affected assessment(s): Replacement assessment grantedCoursework extension grantedExam deferral grantedLate submission accepted without penaltyElement of assessment declared void (not applicable to elements that have a qualifying mark [academic regulation 4.41]\u00a0or contribute more than 20% to the overall module)Adjustment to College and/or course-specific regulations If your request covers modules taken outside your main academic department, the outcome of your application is also sent to the relevant staff in other academic departments who will need to provide mitigation for your assessment. How do I view a completed Mitigating Circumstances request? To view your completed request: Log on\u00a0to\u202fStudent Records.\u00a0Select \u2018Student Home Page\u2019 within the banner at the top of the homepage.\u00a0Select \u2018My Mitigating Circumstances\u2019 within the \u2018My Modules\u2019 area, (as shown in the screenshot below) On\u00a0the Mitigating Circumstances homepage, you will be able to view the \u2018Completed Requests Container\u2019. This container will list any completed requests, both approved and rejected. Important to know:\u00a0 You can view copies of any automated emails received during the decision-making process, by clicking on the \u2018View Email\u2019 button. You can see detailed screenshots of how to view a completed request on Page 9 of the Student Guide for Submitting a Mitigating Circumstances request via Student Records PDF. \u00a0(Within Section 6: Checking the status of a submitted request) What happens if my request is rejected? If your request is rejected, you\u2019ll immediately receive an automated rejection email to your King\u2019s email address. There will be no mitigations applied to any assessments and you should complete them as normal. If you submit your assessment within 24 hours of the deadline passing then you will receive a late submission penalty. Beyond that timeframe or if your exam date has already passed, then you will fail that assessment. If you wanted to appeal the rejection/fail then you would need to submit a Stage One Academic Appeal. Important to know: You aren\u2019t able to re-open or respond to an outcome or rejected request within Student Records. If you require further details or want to make an appeal, please contact your relevant academic department directly.

I\u2019m looking for a GPA conversion for my results If you\u2019re a King\u2019s graduate or a current student approaching the end of your studies, and you are applying to institutions overseas that require a GPA for your degree, you\u2019ll need to use an external service provider to calculate this conversion \u2013 unfortunately King\u2019s can\u2019t provide this for you. UK ENIC is one organisation that provides this service, as does WES, which focuses on the US and Canada. To be sure however, we advise checking with the institution are you applying to about conversion resources, since they may have particular organisations they use to verify conversions or equivalences.

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01797 Print Marking & award classifications at King's At King\u2019s, marking of assessments must be conducted in accordance with the Regulations for taught programmes, the requirements of the Academic Standards Sub-Committee, and approved assessment schemes drawn up by individual Assessment Sub-boards. This article explains the basic principles of marking and award classifications. For further details on how the university assures the quality of its programmes, take a look at the Academic Regulations, Quality & Standards webpage. Marking process The university makes a commitment to ensure that the assessment process is fair, equal and transparent. To meet this commitment, Assessment Sub-Boards select the most appropriate marking model for their assessment type. You should be advised which marking model is being applied to your assessments. There are several official documents on Governance Zone related to marking: College Marking FrameworkGeneric Marking Criteria: UndergraduateGeneric Marking Criteria: Taught PostgraduateKing's Feedback Policy Award classifications To be eligible for an award under the university's Regulations for taught programmes a student must pass a minimum and maximum number of credits at certain levels, in addition to the programme specific requirements. The credit numbers for different levels are listed in the regulations. Masters programmes To determine the final overall average mark, the relative weighting of a module mark will map to the relative weighting of the module\u2019s credit volume based on credit volume. Undergraduate programmes: C-score Undergraduate and Integrated Masters students will have their award calculated using the C Score formula outlined in the Regulations for taught programmes. Undergraduate programmes: certificates & diplomas To determine a final overall average mark, the relative weighting of a module mark will map to the relative weighting of the module\u2019s credit volume based on credit volume. Undergraduate programmes: below level 6 Undergraduate students who registered on programmes that are below Honours level (level 6) will have their award calculated as outlined in the Regulations for taught programmes. What is a condoned fail? A condoned fail is where a student is awarded credit for a module that has a mark below the pass mark but within a specified condonable range. This range is outlined in the Regulations for taught programmes. There may be instances where condonement is not possible, including for core modules, or where there are special requirements for some programmes e.g. Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Bodies regulations. Further details on whether your programme allows condoned fails can be found in your student handbook. Condoned credit and the 2023 marking and assessment boycottCondoned credit may also be awarded under certain conditions in exceptional circumstances, such as industrial action. This was the case for a number of students affected by the 2023 marking and assessment boycott. If you were awarded condoned credit as a result of the boycott, please see this article for further information.

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-02044 Print What are core modules and progression-specific modules? The modules you take as part of your programme are either core or non-core,\u00a0and some may also be core and\u00a0progression-specific.\u00a0This article will explain the different types of module, and their impact on progression and award. What are core and non-core modules? A core module must be passed at some point in your programme in order for you to finish and receive your award. Therefore, it cannot benefit from compensation or condonement. However, a core module does not have to be passed in order to progress from one year to the next; it must simply be passed before the end of your studies.\u00a0Not all programmes have core modules. Some non-core modules may be compulsory, or may be optional, meaning that you will be able to choose whether you want to study them as part of your programme. What are core and progression-specific modules? A module being core and progression-specific means that it must be passed in order to progress from one year of study to the next.\u00a0This will be written into your programme specification. How can I view my modules in Student Records? Undergraduate students who started in the 2022-23 academic year will see modules listed as core or progression-specific in Student Records, when you view your module results. If your programme has any core modules or any core and progression-specific modules, these will be identified in brackets after the module code alongside your results.

You have failed to pass a module that cannot be condoned or compensated and have exhausted your usually permitted assessment attempts. However, due to the impact of the marking and assessment boycott, you have been allowed to continue your studies and have been granted an exceptional additional attempt at the failed module. This exceptional attempt will be set up on your student record in due course. Continuing your studies The decision to grant you an exceptional attempt at the failed module does not impact on your current academic year and you should continue your studies. Further details will be sent to you shortly, including when you can take the exceptional attempt. Exam assessments will be scheduled in the normal way, which is likely to be in Assessment Period 2. To help understand the terms we use around assessment, you may find the Glossary for Academic Regulations helpful. Accessing results Your full results are now available to view on Student Records.

King's College London subscribes to the Higher Education Degree Datacheck (HEDD) which is an online verification service for employers, agencies and educational institutions to verify the qualifications of graduates of the university.The online candidate verification service allows registered enquirers to enter data provided by applicants (name, date of birth, institution, year of graduation, qualification classification etc). In real time, the service checks the information given against an encrypted dataset from the university\u2019s student records and verifies if matched. Important to know: Enquirers will be charged a small fee per enquiry.How to RegisterTo make an enquiry you need to register with HEDD by visiting\u00a0www.hedd.ac.uk. Select \u2018King\u2019s College London\u2019 from the list of UK higher education institutions Choose the option to 'verify a degree award'. If you require further assistance, please email HEDD HelpHow to make an enquiry with HEDDTo make an enquiry please visit\u00a0www.hedd.ac.ukYou will need the following information from the candidate to obtain an Education Verification: individual\u2019s namedate of birthcoursequalificationyear of graduationdegree result\u00a0signed consent form from the individual. Important to know: We recommend that you ask to see the degree certificate if there is one, and use that as the basis of your verification enquiry, or ask individuals to give you their data as they believe it is recorded in the student records system. That way you have a better chance of getting an automatic verification. If you don't get an automatic verification, the enquiry will go to the university for manual verification. For this, we aim for a 5 working-day turnaround time.If you want to verify start dates, please ensure these are requested at the time of making the verification request. For more guidance on using HEDD please see Advice and guidance on degree fraud for employersAdvice and guidance on degree fraud for providers Verifying education for current studentsIf you are looking to verify the studies for a student currently enrolled at King\u2019s, we recommend you ask your candidate/applicant to supply a Confirmation of Study Letter which is the best way for them to prove their course and enrolment status.

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01229 Print What is the Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR)? What is the HEAR and what is it for? The Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR) is an electronic document produced by a higher education institution that provides a record of student achievement during their period of study.It provides detailed information about your learning and achievement to supplement the traditional degree classification and standard transcript, and includes your modules results, any awards attained and your final degree classification. When & why was the HEAR created? The Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR) is designed to encourage a more sophisticated approach to recording student achievement, which acknowledges fully the range of opportunities that higher education institutions in the UK offer to their students.The HEAR replaces the \u2018diploma supplement\u2019 which used to be produced for graduates who needed more detail, especially for getting their degree recognised overseas. The first HEARs were issued by King's in August 2013. Am I eligible to get the HEAR? All taught students studying at King's from the 2012/13 academic year will be eligible to receive a HEAR.Students registered on an Intercalated BSc programme will become eligible to receive a HEAR when their substantive Medical or Dental Programme becomes eligible.If you studied sometime between 2000 and 2012, you won\u2019t have a Gradintel account for your HEAR automatically, but it may be possible for us to create one. If this is the case for you, please log a case and we will liaise with the KCL HEAR team to support you.For more information about options for alumni prior to 2012, please read our article I\u2019m King\u2019s alumni and I need to prove my degree. Postgraduate research graduatesUnfortunately, we\u2019re not able to offer the HEAR for research graduates. This is because research studies don\u2019t follow a prescribed set of modules. If this is you, and you\u2019re looking for documentation, Student Services can help. For more information, we advise reading\u00a0our article I need to prove I\u2019ve graduated if you graduated this year, or you may find\u00a0I\u2019m King\u2019s alumni and I need to prove my degree\u00a0more helpful if you graduated last year or earlier. How much detail does the HEAR contain? The HEAR follows a nationally agreed schema which King\u2019s adopts. If you would like to know what the HEAR contains and what it looks like\u00a0view an example of this letter\u00a0online. Module marks & degree awardYour HEAR will contain the overall mark for each module you have achieved. This information will be added each year of your studies, as the modules are ratified and released. Once you completed your course and your degree has been awarded, your degree classification will also be included. PlacementsUnfortunately, we\u2019re not yet able to include placement information on the HEAR, however we hope to be able to do this in the future.In the meantime, if you\u2019re seeking placement information we would advise contacting your department/faculty\u00a0directly who would hold this information. Or, if you need support obtaining this information as part of a document from King\u2019s, please log a case with Student Services and we will do our best to help you. Student Selected ComponentsUnfortunately, we\u2019re not yet able to include information about Student Selected Components (SSCs) on the HEAR, however we hope to be able to do this in the future.In the meantime, if you need information about this we advise contacting your department, or please log a case and we will do our best to support you. Can I choose what information is included in my HEAR?Most of the information on the HEAR is nationally defined and can\u2019t be changed. However, students will have the option to display some items in the \u2018Additional information\u2019 section, or section 6.1.This section is particularly useful, because it provides a place for your extra-curricular activities to be officially recorded by the university. Previously, there was no capacity for this type of information to be formally documented. To request extra achievements to be added to your HEAR, please contact your department/faculty. When will my HEAR show all my results? During January, July and September HEARs are updated daily following the ratification of results by the relevant assessment board. During these busy periods, please allow 2-3 working days for the information to be updated.\u00a0During the rest of the year, HEARs are updated weekly on a Monday, following ratification of results by the relevant Assessment Sub Board. Does the HEAR contain information which meets professional requirements? No, unfortunately the current\u00a0schema does not allow for the inclusion of additional information required by students applying for certain professions, such as Nursing.\u00a0In these cases, transcripts with this information will remain available, and we continue to review what we can do to enhance our documents.If you graduated from a course where you need additional information to be added to your transcript, such as about placements or syllabus details, please see our article I need a specialised transcript for my course for more information. My HEAR is missing information/has incorrect details. What should I do? If the information on your HEAR is incorrect, please log a case and will look into this for you with support from the KCL HEAR team. How can I access my HEAR? You can access your\u00a0Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR)\u00a0yourself through your Gradintelligence account that King\u2019s has already set up for you; you just need to activate it. Important to know: Please don't register yourself for your own account on Gradintel. This creates an account which is not linked to your student record and your HEAR won't appear there. King's has automatically created Gradintel accounts for every graduate since 2012, which is linked to your student record. Please read\u00a0Accessing my Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR) on Gradintel\u00a0for steps in accessing your account, including details on helping you troubleshoot any issues you may experience.

As such, administration and records for courses have changed and the documentation available to you is likely to depend on when you studied with us. Started your course at King's in 2012 or later? All taught students studying at King's from the 2012/13 academic year will be eligible to receive a Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR).The HEAR is an electronic document designed to be shared digitally. This is a great document to prove all the details of your degree and we encourage it\u2019s use for all those who are eligible to access it.You can also now access your digital transcript through the same Gradintel platform as your HEAR.Online verificationDid you know that an employer or other third party can verify your degree online? They can go directly to an online service called HEDD and we recommend this for those looking for an education verification for King's graduate\u00a0in addition to your HEAR, transcript and degree certificate. Find out more in our article\u00a0How can an employer or other agency verify a degree from King\u2019s? Started your course at King's before 2012? If you graduated before 2012/3\u00a0you won\u2019t automatically have a Gradintel account, but as long as your module results are held on our electronic student records, it should still be possible for us to produce a digital transcript for you.

Find out more in our article\u00a0How can an employer or other agency verify a degree from King\u2019s? Started your course at King's before 2006? King\u2019s was given awarding powers in 2006. Prior to using those powers, the university awarded degrees from the University of London. If you started before 2006 but graduated shortly after that year, it may be possible you were offered the choice of being awarded a King\u2019s degree or University of London degree. Please check your original degree certificate to be sure. If you were awarded a University of London degree, you are most likely to be able to obtain documentation from University of London Transcripts Office. If you enrolled in 2007 you should have a certificate from King's; all students who enrolled at King's from the 2007-8 academic year onwards, were provided with a King's degree certificate. If have lost your degree certificate, or for any reason you are unsure which institution awarded your degree, please don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch with us and make a request \u2013 Student Services can look into this for you. Online verificationThere is an online education verification service called HEDD, and we\u00a0recommend this for those looking for an education verification for a King's graduate in addition to your\u00a0transcript and degree certificate. If King's holds electronic records for you, these should be available through HEDD, but an employer, agency, embassy or other third party can use this service to check your qualifications.\u00a0Find out more in our article\u00a0How can an employer or other agency verify a degree from King\u2019s? Studied a postgraduate research degree? Postgraduate research degrees are not modularised, which means they are not credit rated and measured in the same way as taught courses. This means transcripts are not possible for research degrees; this is the case whether you are a recent graduate or graduated years ago.If this is you, we recommend using your degree certificate to prove your degree. If this is not possible, Student Services can produce an Award letter for you. Please refer to the guidance below on how to log a case and make a request with us, and we will do our best to produce the documentation you need.Important to know:\u00a0We will always do our best to produce any documentation that you need. However, depending on how long it has been since you graduated and how much information is still held on record for you, this may take longer than our usual 5-working days turnaround time to produce. As such, please allow plenty of time for us to fulfil your request. How can I request a document? The process for requesting documents from us as a former student or alumnus is different to that for current students, because\u00a0you will likely not have\u00a0login credentials\u00a0(your King\u2019s login will typically expire soon after your course end date).For data protection reasons, we also need as much detail from you as possible so we can locate your record in our system and confirm a match.To\u00a0request documents from us: Visit the\u00a0Former Student document request form. Please don't change the pre-populated category and sub-category fields.Complete the additional fields on the form.If you still have your student ID number, please include this.Once all fields are completed and you've attached any relevant files, select 'Submit'.Student Services will then process your request and contact you if they have any clarification questions. Important to know:\u00a0It's easier for us to identify you if you provide the personal email address we have on\u00a0record. If we cannot match the information you submit, we will\u00a0always\u00a0contact you\u00a0to confirm certain personal details\u00a0before proceeding\u00a0to ensure we are protecting your data.

For more information on using Gradintel, please see our article\u00a0How can I access my Gradintel account? How can I check if I\u2019ve been awarded? Your result will be available on your\u00a0student record. Your results can take some time to be processed through on to your record, following the Assessment Sub Board\u2019s decision. Since this is organised by faculty and department, the exact timings may vary depending on your department.

I\u2019m looking for a GPA conversion for my results If you\u2019re a King\u2019s graduate or a current student approaching the end of your studies, and you are applying to institutions overseas that require a GPA for your degree, you\u2019ll need to use an external service provider to calculate this conversion; unfortunately King\u2019s can\u2019t provide this for you.ENIC\u00a0is one organisation that provides this service, as does\u00a0WES, which focuses on the US and Canada. To be sure however, we advise checking with the institution are you applying to about conversion resources, since they may have particular organisations they use to verify conversions or equivalences. I'm in-between; I've completed my course but awaiting results It often takes time for results to be released after you have completed all your assessments, which means you can finish your course and still be awaiting results.During this time, it\u2019s likely you will need to prove completion of your course, but this can be difficult if your results haven\u2019t yet been finalised. If you need to offer proof to a third party such as an employer, another institution for further study, or any other organisation - you may find our Pre-Award letter helpful; see I need to prove I\u2019ve finished my course and am awaiting results for more details.

Transcripts are not available for current students.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b My transcript is not yet available; are there any other documents available to me to confirm my results so far? Yes; you can obtain a Record of Agreed Results letter to show your module results so far. To find out more about this document and how to access it, go to I need to prove my module results so far.What is the difference between the Record of Agreed Results letter and the final transcript?The Record of Agreed Results letter (ROAR) is intended to be an interim transcript aimed at current students. This helps you prove your module results as you progress through your course. You can access this document at any time from your Gradintel account.There is\u00a0one key point of difference between the documents:The transcript is only available to completed and awarded students and intended to be used in partnership with your degree certificate. The ROAR is available at any time during your course as soon as you have some ratified results; this is perfect for tracking your ongoing progress.Both documents: Are available to you as digital documents on the\u00a0Gradintel\u00a0platform.Are official documents issued by the university and\u00a0only\u00a0show ratified results. Important to know:\u00a0We are unable to produce any document showing \u2018provisional\u2019 results. Do I need the transcript to apply for study abroad during my course? No; the best document for you to use is your Record of Agreed Results (ROAR) available on the Gradintel website.

Final awards are usually available sometime after (and not before) the official course end date.

I need my transcript from studying abroad I studied abroad during my course; how can I get a transcript for my studies at the host institution? If during your course at King\u2019s, you spent a period of your studies overseas studying at another institution, marks you received for your studies there will be primarily held by your host institution.The usual practice for our partner universities is; once your result are released, they share a copy of the transcript with the Global Mobility Office, and this is then shared with your department here at King\u2019s. In some instances, the university may share the transcript with you directly.If you\u2019re looking for a copy of your transcript, you may contact the Global Mobility Office. However, please be aware that not every institution will share transcripts in the same way, and if you\u2019re looking for a transcript from a few years ago, we can\u2019t guarantee we still hold this here at King\u2019s.For a full, official transcript from your studies abroad, you would need to contact your host institution, and follow their guidance on obtaining a transcript. I\u2019m an overseas student who studied at KCL for my semester/year abroad; how can I get my KCL transcript? You\u2019ll have a Record of Agreed Results letter for the modules you studied with us, whether it was for one semester or for a full year. As for all our students, you will be able to access this document through Gradintel. If you studied at King\u2019s some time since 2012, you can access your Record of Agreed Results through Gradintel. If you attended after 2018, you should already have access and can reset passwords directly on Gradintel. For details on how to log in to this account, please follow in the guidance in our article Accessing my Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR) on Gradintel.If you attended before 2018 or never activated your account, please log a case including your King\u2019s student ID number if you still have it, and we will look into getting your account activated for you. Important to know: The HEAR, Transcript and Record of Agreed Results are all hosted on Gradintel and are accessible there in the same way. When you log in you will see all the documents which are available to you. Courses for which transcripts are not available Withdrawing from your course Unfortunately, if you withdrew from your course before completing, you wouldn\u2019t be eligible to obtain a final transcript.Instead however, you can obtain a Record of Agreed Results (ROAR) letter\u00a0which will be available on your Gradintel account, if you started some time since 2012. If you withdrew recently, please refer to I need to prove my module results so far for details around accessing your ROAR.For further guidance around accessing your Gradintel account, including to troubleshoot any issues with access you may be experiencing, please refer to our guidance on accessing Gradintel.If you studied before 2012 and don\u2019t have a Gradintel account, please see our article\u00a0I\u2019m King\u2019s alumni and I need to prove my degree for support. Student Services may be able to produce a Record of Agreed Results (ROAR) letter for you if you\u2019re unable to access one through other means. Transcripts which are not produced at King\u2019s Unfortunately, there are a small number of courses which we\u2019re unable to produce transcripts for. The majority are courses which ran at King\u2019s more than 10 years ago; a small number of them are more recent but have special arrangements.This is a list of those courses; if you studied any of these please check for details on how this affects you and what you can do. If your course is not listed here, you may find the information in I\u2019m King\u2019s alumni and I need to prove my degree more helpful. Research graduates If you studied a research degree, a transcript is not possible because your results are not modular (as they are for taught courses). Examples of these types of degrees are: Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Master of Philosophy (MPhil), Doctor of Education (EdD), Doctor of Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy) and Doctor of Medicine (MD). Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) Courses at RADA are accredited by King\u2019s College London. Our role here is to process your award and produce certificates, but all teaching and assessment is done at RADA. This means that if you\u2019re looking for a transcript, this would be issued by RADA rather than KCL, and you\u2019re best to approach support services at RADA to find out how to obtain this. Bachelor of Law (LLB) & Master of Law (LLM) transcripts Joint LLB transcriptsTranscripts for the LLB taught jointly with another institution will not include\u00a0a breakdown of the marks obtained at the other university.\u00a0For details of these results, you will need to contact the other university directly.LLM transcriptsIf you studied on the LLM Programme and graduated before 2000, you are best to\u00a0contact the University of London since you would have been awarded a University of London degree, and they will hold your information.All their contact information and details on how to make your request can be found at\u00a0University of London - Transcripts Office. Bachelor of Music transcripts (BMus) pre-1996 If you studied on the Bachelor of Music Degree (BMus) before 1996 you may not be able to obtain your\u00a0official academic transcript. Unfortunately, this is because some of the records are incomplete.In cases where the transcripts are unavailable or indeed you studied this course before 1996, we advise logging a case with us and letting us know what you need and why, and Student Services can look into what we may hold on record for you, and what it might possible to produce for you. For some more information, you may find this article helpful -\u00a0I\u2019m King\u2019s alumni and I need to prove my degree. Postgraduate Masters pre-2000 Unfortunately, if you completed a taught Masters degree before 1989 you won\u2019t be able to order an academic transcript because before this time, universities were not required to keep detailed records. Depending on the course studied, this can sometimes apply to Masters programmes dating up to 2000.However, if it is crucial that you obtain a document detailing your course and results, and you studied some time before the year 2000, we can offer 2 options which may be a help: If you graduated at this time, you will hold a University of London degree (rather than a King\u2019s College London degree) and so we advise contacting the\u00a0University of London - Transcripts Office\u00a0to enquire whether they hold any records for you.Student Services\u00a0can investigate your record and look into what, if any, information may be held about your studies with us. To explore this option, please\u00a0log a case\u00a0with us and provide as many details as possible to help us locate your record. \u2018Federal\u2019 or University of London courses \u2018Federal\u2019 courses, as they are sometimes known, are historical courses held at King\u2019s but fully administered and awarded by the University of London (UoL). These ran over several years in the past, and covered a wide range of subjects. For this, you would have enrolled at King\u2019s, and had your teaching and marking with us, but all your results would have been ratified by assessment boards at UoL, and UoL would produce all certificates and transcripts.Important to know:\u00a0This is not to be confused with courses running before 2008 at King\u2019s, which were fully taught and administered by King\u2019s, but awarded by UoL, because this was at a time before King\u2019s was granted awarding powers.

Who is considered a carer?A carer is defined as anyone who looks after a family member, partner or friend who needs help because of their illness, frailty, disability, a mental health problem or an addiction and cannot cope without their support. The care they give is unpaid.It\u2019s likely that every one of us will have caring responsibilities at some time in our lives. Many carers juggle their caring responsibilities with work, study and other family commitments. Some, in particular younger carers, are often not known to be carers. Sometimes they don\u2019t tell relatives, friends or health and care professionals about their responsibilities because of a fear of separation, guilt, pride or other reasons.The sort of roles and responsibilities that carers provide varies widely. It can range from help with everyday tasks such as getting out of bed and personal care such as bathing, to emotional support such as helping someone cope with the symptoms of a mental illness.To find out more visit NHS: Who is considered a carer?

If you are a research student, please speak to the Centre for Doctoral Studies. Early options and medical support Whether starting a family was planned or unplanned, you may find you feel confused or anxious about your situation. It is very important that you seek medical advice as soon as possible to discuss your options and seek maternity health care. Any contact with healthcare professionals will be strictly confidential. If you are registered with the\u00a0King\u2019s NHS Health Centre\u00a0you can arrange to see a doctor there, otherwise you can attend\u00a0your local GP surgery or visit an NHS walk-in centre. Use the NHS's Find a GP webpage to help you do this.If you wish to discuss your situation, you may also consider contacting the\u00a0Counselling & Mental Health Support Service. Contacting your department and taking time out from study If you are comfortable doing so, you should contact your department/faculty as soon as possible to discuss your options. You can do this via our article Contacting & visiting your faculty and department. This will allow you to make plans for future study and to ensure any special measures are taken to safeguard your welfare.Whatever choice you make regarding your pregnancy, you are likely to require some time out of your studies. This should be discussed with your department in the first instance to look at how best to work this around your programme. You should also seek advice from our support services\u00a0as an interruption may impact your finances, housing and for those on student visas, your immigration status. To learn more about the help available, read our article What student support services are available at King's? For more information on interrupting please read our article How can I take a break from my course? Immigration issues: studying on a visa Becoming pregnant is not a breach of your Student or Tier 4 Visa but as an international student becoming pregnant and taking time out of your studies can affect your immigration status. We therefore strongly recommend that you make an appointment with our Visa & International Advice\u00a0team as soon as possible to discuss your options. To learn more about support with visas, visit our article What student support services are available at King's?You will probably need to take time out of your studies in order to have your baby. The university will need to record this absence and may need to report it to the UK Border Agency resulting in your visa being curtailed. \u00a0You would not be in any trouble because of this, but you would need to leave the UK. You would need to\u00a0apply for a new visa\u00a0via the UK government's Student Visa page when you are ready to come back and resume your studies. Important to know: It is important that you plan ahead when preparing to leave the UK, as some airlines will not allow you to\u00a0fly towards the end of your pregnancy. For more information, read the NHS's Travelling in pregnancy webpage. If you have your baby in the UK If you do have your baby in the UK, it will not be deemed to be a British Citizen (unless one parent is British or has settled status in the UK). The baby will have the same nationality as its parents and you should check with your embassy what you need to do to register the baby\u2019s birth.You are not required by law to obtain a visa for your baby as your baby can remain in the UK with you as your dependant. However, if you choose to leave the UK and wish to return, you will need to obtain a dependant\u2019s visa for your baby. You can obtain this from your home country or apply before you leave the UK. Bringing your dependents back to the UK If you want to bring your baby back to the UK, you will need to apply for a visa so that s/he can come in as your dependant. There are strict rules surrounding who can bring dependants, so we recommend you read UKCISA's guide on Dependents carefully. The UKVI is very strict about who can bring dependants to the UK. Important to know: In order to bring dependant children to the UK,\u00a0both\u00a0parents need to be resident here, except in exceptional circumstances.You may also find our article on Managing childcare alongside your studies\u00a0useful.We understand that pregnancy can be stressful. If there are any practical issues you would like to discuss, then you can make an appointment to\u00a0chat to an adviser via our article What student support services are available at King's? Funding for UK students If you're in receipt of maintenance loans and grants\u00a0through\u00a0Student Finance England\u00a0or a regional funder, it is important that you contact them and\u00a0notify them of your change in circumstances. Your student loan can continue for up to 60 days from the beginning of an interruption of study.PhD students who are in receipt of scholarships should contact the relevant funder as your award may be suspended during the time you are interrupted.For more detail about the impact on funding during an interruption, please read How will interrupting impact my fees and funding? Once the baby has been born, you may be eligible for some financial help through benefits or the university if you are struggling financially. Depending on your circumstances, as a student with dependants you may be able to claim: Welfare benefits\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Child Benefit (some income restrictions apply)Universal Credit; this can include help with housing costs and allowances for dependantsStudent fundingDependants GrantParent Learning AllowanceChildcare GrantNHS Learning Support Fund; has additional elements for student parents on NHS-funded courses Check with your funding body for more details of what you can claim when are on a break and what you can apply for when you return to the course.If you are a student from the EEA, you will need to meet certain residency tests to claim benefits in the UK. These can be very complicated, so we recommend that you arrange an appointment to contact the Money & Housing Advice team\u00a0to check your eligibility if you have any questions. Important to know:\u00a0If you are an international student living in the UK, you are not usually permitted to claim welfare benefits. However, there may be some options if you have been working. If you would like to find out more or you are experiencing financial difficulties as a result of having your child/children, contact the Money & Housing Advice team. Risk assessments For some students becoming pregnant may have an impact on their studies and this may need to be addressed in the form of a risk assessment competed by your faculty. This is likely to affect you if you are PhD student who intends to undertake fieldwork as part of your research, and/or if you are on a health-related course. You should also take into consideration travel with regards to research fieldwork and check with your doctor/midwife if you are required to travel long distances or take flights as part of your studies, in line with the NHS's guidance on Travelling in pregnancy.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Keywords: pregnancy abortion take a break withdraw having a child children Related Articles (4) How can I find out about NHS services?

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01785 Print Managing childcare alongside your studies Coming to university is a time of change no matter what your circumstances. This is particularly true of students who are also parents or carers. This article is to help you plan your childcare and think through what you need to organise.Every parent\u2019s situation is different \u2013 and of course every student is different. Some will have timetables that change on a regular basis, some will have course-related placements and others will have a fairly static schedule. We have put together this information on the different types of childcare that are available, particularly if you are not familiar with childcare in the UK, as well as the questions you will need to ask yourself about how the arrangements may or may not fit in around your studies.In this article: ChildmindersDay care provisionNursery schools Before and after-school care Funding childcareBalancing childcare & course attendanceStudying on a visa with dependentsFurther resources for childcare support Childminders What is a childminder? A registered childminder is someone who can look after your child from their own home. To gain registration, the childminder\u2019s home is inspected by the government to ensure that it is a safe environment for children. In addition childminders have to provide references, prove that they are healthy, trained and are checked by the police. Subsequent government inspections are held on a regular basis. Childminders can look after children of any age although the regulations on registration only apply when they are looking after children under the age of 8. Important to know: The government also stipulates that: Childminders can look after up to 6 children under the age of 8;Of those 6, no more than 3 of those can be under the age of 5;Of those no more than 1 child should be under the age of 1 year old It is therefore essential that you ask who else a childminder is looking after, how often and what their ages are. Advantages for student parents Childminders are registered, as are their homes, and are fully trained. You can often find one near to where you live and will probably find that they are able to be a lot more flexible than a day nursery. Your child will be in a small home environment normally with other children. Childminders can often help with after school care or school pick up and drop offs for older siblings meaning that you can keep your children together. Your child will be looked after by the same person. Disadvantages for student parents If the childminder is also a parent or has other caring responsibilities they may want to organise their routine accordingly rather than to your specific needs. Your child may not be comfortable with older children. They will be unlikely to look after your child if the child is unwell. How much will it cost? It will be up to you to negotiate a contract with your childminder. This will have to include working hours, arrangements for pick up and drop off of your child, holidays and overtime. In London you can expect to pay a minimum \u00a36 per hour, but prices do vary. Do remember that childminders are self-employed and as such can set their own fees. How do I choose a childminder? You will obviously want to know about their qualifications, registration and home environment. You may also want to ask questions about their flexibility in terms of your timetable \u2013 especially if it is likely to change during the year due to placements. If you are on a clinical or teaching placement during the year that requires you to need childcare earlier than 08.00 for parts of the year, ask if the childminder can accommodate this. Personal chemistry with a childminder is also important. After all, they will be looking after your child for a good deal of their day. Ask them: How they will deal with discipline issuesHow they will encourage your child to settle with themWho else will be in the houseUnder what circumstances would they try to get into contact with your whilst you were at university or working in the library. For information on what to expect from a childminder you can visit the National Childminding Association (NCMA). For information on day nurseries near to where you live as well as the university visit the government's Find a registered childminder page. Day care provision What is day care provision? A day nursery can look after children, up to the age of 5 years, for all or part of a day and is usually open from 08.00 through to 19.00. Children are normally grouped with others of a similar age and are cared for by qualified staff, some of whom have to have a teaching qualification. All day nurseries have to be registered with the government and are subject to regular quality inspections. Day nurseries follow the government\u2019s \u2018Early Years Curriculum\u2019 which helps to prepare children for School. Advantages for student parents If you know your timetable, day nurseries can sometimes offer a part-time place that is flexible enough to fit with your academic work. You will have the reassurance that the day nursery is approved and regularly inspected against a prescribed set of criteria. Your child will be looked after by experienced and qualified staff. Your child will be with others their own age in a safe, educational and fun setting. Disadvantages for student parents There are sometimes long waiting lists for nurseries so students often have to make temporary childcare arrangements until a suitable place becomes available. Day nurseries can be expensive and will not be able to look after your child if they are unwell. Nurseries may not be able to offer you a flexible contract if your timetable changes or you have to take up a placement as part of your course. Most day nurseries only offer 50-week contracts which for undergraduate students is often too long. If you are considering taking your child out of a day nursery for the summer vacation check first to find out if your child\u2019s place will be held for the following September. How much will it cost? In London you can expect to pay from \u00a3100 to \u00a3200 per week on childcare provided by a day nursery. You may also be required to provide food and snacks. How do I choose day care provision? Over and above the normal questions you will want to ask about the provision and quality of the actual nursery you will also need to ask: Do you want to have your child looked after near to where you live or near to where you study? Can the nursery offer you a 39-week contract if you are an undergraduate? Will your timetable change during the year and can this be accommodated by the nursery? For information on day nurseries near to where you live as well as the university visit the UK government's Find a registered childminder page. Nursery schools What is nursery school? If your child is between the ages of 3-5 then you may want to consider sending them either to a nursery class, normally attached to a primary school or a nursery school. The latter is a self-contained school with its own head teacher and staff. Both nursery schools and nursery classes can be run by the government or be independent (private). Both have to be approved and inspected by the government and would almost certainly follow the government \u2018Early Years Curriculum\u2019. The ratio of staff to children is much greater in this setting which may or may not suit your child. The guidelines allow for between 20 \u2013 26 children to be looked after by 2 adults, one of whom has to be a qualified teacher, the other a trained nursery nurse or classroom assistant. Advantages of day nurseries for student parents Your child would be looked after in a safe and regulated environment. Your child would be in an educational setting with their peers. Children in state nursery classes will normally be able to then join the reception class of the School they are already in meaning less change for them. Disadvantages of day nurseries for student parents Many nursery places are only for half a day meaning that you will have to arrange other forms of childcare to manage your needs. Nursery classes normally only run on the school academic year which will be different to that of the university. You often have to live within a certain catchment area and there is sometimes a waiting list.There may be fees to pay although some children may be entitled to a free early years place. How much will it cost? Pre-school nursery places are normally free unless the provision is a community pre-school \u2013 in which case the cost can be around \u00a33.50 per session. If you are choosing an independent pre-school place you can expect to pay up to \u00a31000 per term in London although you may be eligible for a free part time place. For a list of your local nurseries visit the UK government's Find a registered childminder page How do I choose a nursery? You will want to check that the facility is registered and if they are following the governments \u2018Early Years Curriculum\u2019. It would be reasonable to ask to visit the school or facility and meet the staff. It would also be important for you to be clear on the nursery timetable and how this will fit in with your university timetable. If you are arranging other childcare, such as a childminder or a relative, to collect your child from the nursery you will have to give written permission. Before and after-school care Although your child may be old enough to be in school it is likely that you may still need some additional childcare for times when your academic timetable will not run parallel to that of your child\u2019s. Childminders Some childminders will be able to provide before and after school care for your child or children. This usually means that you would be able to drop your child off before school. The childminder would take your child to school and pick them up at the end of the day. This can be a very flexible and useful arrangement for students \u2013 particularly if you have placements you need to travel to early in the morning or your timetable can be variable. You would have to negotiate terms and conditions as well as cost with your childminder for this extended service. For more detail on this, refer to our information on childminders above. Breakfast and after-school clubs Many schools now have breakfast or after school clubs for children whose parents work or study. There is a charge for these facilities but the advantage is that, normally, children are in the same location all day. After-school clubs can include homework clubs or additional craft, sport or music lessons. Breakfast clubs cost on average \u00a31 per day and after-school clubs cost on average \u00a33 \u2013 5 per day depending on the activities your child chooses to do. Holiday schemes Although the King\u2019s timetable runs on a standard academic year, not all courses have a reading week or \u2018half term\u2019, therefore don\u2019t assume that you will be free to look after your child or children during their half term. Even if your course does have a reading week it may not coincide exactly with your child\u2019s term dates and you may be required to attend university for tutorials. Holiday schemes are run by local authorities who employ qualified and vetted staff and can be booked on a daily or weekly basis and vary in cost. Details on schemes can be found via your local education authority; see our further resources.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Funding childcare How will I pay for my childcare? The Childcare Grant is available to full-time home students and EU migrant workers, in low-income households. To qualify, you must have a dependent child or children in registered or approved childcare. If you qualify, you can receive up to 85% of your actual childcare costs. You don\u2019t have to repay this help.How much you get will depend on: Your level of income and the income of your household\u00a0How many children you have in childcareYour actual childcare costs The childcare grant is paid as part of your student funding package and covers all forms of childcare including school clubs provided it is registered and approved.Important to know:\u00a0To qualify, your partner must not already be receiving the childcare element of Working Tax credit. All other students are required to pay for their childcare through their own income or student funding/scholarship.In some circumstances you may be eligible for benefits and if you suffer financial hardship the university may be able to provide some limited assistance. Where can I get help and advice on funding my childcare? The\u00a0Money & Housing Advice Team\u00a0are available all year round to advise student parents.You may also be interested in our\u00a0Student Parents video series.We also have further advice and information in the following articles on funding more generally: What are the fees and funding options available for undergraduate study?What are the fees and funding options available for postgraduate study?What loans, grants or scholarships can I get from King\u2019s? Balancing childcare & course attendance Is there any childcare provision on campus? No, there is no childcare on any of the main university sites. There is limited provision for some staff and students in an NHS trust nursery at the Denmark Hill Campus and Guy's Campus.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Can I bring my child to university? Children should not be brought routinely to university. If however, you need to briefly visit university then you can bring your child with you. However, they must be supervised by you at all times, and not left on their own in the library, food outlets or anywhere else on campus. My childcare plans have fallen through - what do I do? If you are unable to attend university it is essential that you contact your department as soon as possible to let them know, and ensure that new childcare arrangements are made as soon as possible. What should I do if my child becomes suddenly ill and I have tutorials that day? Will it affect my attendance for modules? If you find yourself unable to suddenly attend teaching, try to get in contact with the academic running the session or your module lead. Explain your circumstance and see what help they can offer in terms of catch-up at another date or any recommendations to resources to help make up for the missed session. Depending on your course, attendance and engagement may make up a proportion of your module. If you are concerned about how this will affect you, speak to your module/course lead. It is also worth informing your personal tutor if you find yourself having to miss lots of sessions, as together you can work on ways to avoid this or seek extra support to help you with your studies. We also recommend approaching your personal tutor to help you in planning/balancing your caring responsibilities with your studies. You can learn more about your personal tutor by reading our article What do I talk about with my personal tutor? What do I do if my child falls sick during exam week? Contact your personal tutor and explain your circumstance. If you or your child becomes unwell it is important to notify the course lead and your personal tutor. You might feel as though your ability to study or complete an assessment is affected, in which we recommend learning about King\u2019s mitigating circumstances, and how this might help you.

If your course lasts less than 6 months there is no provision to bring your dependants with you \u2013 but they can visit for short periods as a tourist. If you are applying for a dependant\u2019s visa read the regulations carefully and consult\u00a0UKCISA\u00a0and refer to our information and guidance in Immigration & visa advice.

Undergraduate Home students & EU migrant workers Welfare benefits for families\u00a0Child Benefit is a tax-free payment that you can claim for your child. It is usually paid every four weeks but in some cases can be paid weekly, and there are separate rates for each child. The payment can be claimed by anyone who qualifies but is reduced if the income of a parent (or their partner) is more than \u00a350k per year, as explained on Direct Gov's High Income Child Benefit Charge webpage.Child Tax Credit has largely been replaced with Universal Credit, although it may be an option for some people. For details please read Can I get Child Tax Credit? If you live with a partner and their income is low, or they are out of work, you may qualify for universal credit or other welfare benefits, depending on your situation and if anyone is sick or disabled in your home.\u00a0 Important to know: Some of your student finance package will count as income in any claims for means tested benefits, whether you claim\u00a0student funding or not, but there are disregards that can be applied. \u00a0Sometimes there can be errors in how the income has been assessed so you are strongly advised to have your award from the DWP or student finance checked by a Money Adviser in the\u00a0Money & Housing Advice team. Student Finance for Undergraduate full-time Home students & qualifying EU students\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Home students are usually eligible to apply for a student support package from\u00a0Student Finance England\u00a0or\u00a0their regional funder. Some EU students may also qualify if they have the relevant status in the UK.As a student parent, you can also apply for additional means-tested funding (regardless of previous study) to assist with the added costs of being a parent and/or supporting an adult dependant whilst studying full-time. Important to know: If you are in receipt of benefits then you must declare any loans from Student Finance England, Hardship Funds or the NHS Learning Support Fund.\u00a0There may be restrictions in the support available to you if you have previously studied a degree programme. Childcare Grant A Childcare Grant is available to full-time students in low-income households. To qualify, you must have a dependent child or children in registered or OFSTED approved childcare. If you qualify, you can receive an allowance to help with your childcare costs, the amount and qualifying criteria is set by your regional funder, check locally for full information: UK Gov: Childcare Grant Student Finance Wales: Childcare Grant\u00a0and Parents Learning AllowanceStudent Finance Northern Ireland: Childcare GrantStudent Awards Agency Scotland: Other sources of funding You don\u2019t have to repay this help. How much you get will also depend on: your level of income and the income of your householdhow many children you have in childcareyour actual childcare costs The childcare grant is paid as part of your student funding package and covers many forms of childcare including school clubs, provided it is registered and approved. Important to know: To qualify your partner must not already be receiving the childcare element of Working Tax credit. Parents Learning Allowance This is an additional grant to assist student parents with the costs of books, travel etc. As with the Childcare Grant, the award is based on your household income and is paid to you as part of your student funding package.

You don't have to repay this help.\u00a0An adult dependant can include a partner or another adult, usually a member of your family, who depends on you financially. However, you can't count your grown-up children as adult dependants. How much you get depends on your income and the income of your adult dependant. NHS Learning Support Fund If you are a student on a healthcare course such as Nursing, Midwifery or Physiotherapy and you started your course on or after 1 August 2017 then you may be eligible for some additional financial help through the NHS Learning Support Fund. This fund includes a Parental Support Grant of \u00a32000,\u00a0which can be paid in addition to the Student Finance parent related funds and, for many, may include the \u00a35000 Training Grant. In addition to the \u00a35,000 training grant, there is also an exceptional support fund for severe financial hardship.\u00a0 Any awards made from this fund don\u2019t have to be re-paid.\u00a0You can find out about the eligibility criteria for this fund by visiting NHS Learning Support Fund. NHS Bursaries for medics and dentists From the 5th\u00a0year of study medics and dentists in England, switch to a funding package from the NHS Bursary Service. This includes a non-repayable grant for tuition fees and a bursary for living costs, with additional allowances for student parents and childcare costs.\u00a0 This is calculated in a different way and many medics and dentists find that their award for living costs can be less when NHS funding starts.\u00a0 To help buffer this, King\u2019s created the Medical & Dental Hardship Fund and the NHS also has a hardship fund which you can apply to.\u00a0 For more information please review the NHS Bursary Guidance. Continuing non-medical healthcare students who originally started their course before 1 August 2017 If you are a continuing nursing, midwifery, physio or nutrition & dietetics student and you started your course prior to 1 August 2017, you may still receive funding under the old NHS bursary rules.\u00a0 This is not the same as the NHS Learning Support Fund, and is made up of a reduced rate maintenance loan and NHS bursary for living costs, which includes elements for childcare costs.\u00a0 If this is not enough to cover all your costs, you can apply to hardship funds at King\u2019s and we also advise get in touch with your department to review if you have had a sufficient break from study to apply under the new rules.We strongly advise contacting the\u00a0Money & Housing Advice team\u00a0for guidance. Part-time undergraduate Home students and some EU students If you are a part-time student with children or other dependants, you may qualify for help with your course fees and/or course costs. If your course started on or after 1 August 2018, then you can apply for a tuition fee loan and a maintenance loan. If you have a low income, a disability or have caring responsibilities you may also be eligible for welfare benefits, but your student finance will be counted as income for means tested benefits if you claim it or not.\u00a0 Please consult the\u00a0Money & Housing Advice team\u00a0or a local advice agency for bespoke advice. Postgraduate Home students & EU migrant workers Welfare benefits for families\u00a0Child Benefit is a tax-free payment that you can claim for your child.

If you live with a partner and their income is low, or they are out of work, you may qualify for universal credit or other welfare benefits, depending on your situation and if anyone is sick or disabled in your home.\u00a0 Please note that if you are claiming a postgraduate loan some of this will count as income even if you intend to use it all to pay for your tuition fees.\u00a0 However, sometimes there can be errors in how the income has been assessed by the DWP so you are strongly advised to have your award checked by a Money Adviser in the\u00a0Money & Housing Advice team. Student Finance Postgraduate Home students & qualifying EU workers Home students are usually eligible to apply for a Postgraduate Loan from\u00a0Student Finance England\u00a0or\u00a0their regional funder to help with the costs of postgraduate study. Important to know: You may not be eligible if you if you have previously studied a degree programme at this level.\u00a0If you\u2019re an EU student you may also qualify if you have the relevant status in the UK. To find out more, visit the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA)'s Governmant Student Support page.Unlike undergraduate study, student parents cannot apply for additional funding to help with the added costs of being a parent and/or supporting an adult dependant whilst studying at postgraduate level, unless you are undertaking a pre-registration healthcare course and qualify for the NHS Learning Support Fund. NHS Learning Support Fund From 1 August 2018 new students attending a pre-registration, postgraduate healthcare course will also be eligible to apply for support from the NHS Learning Support Fund. This fund includes a Parental Support Grant of \u00a32000, in addition to the \u00a35,000 training grant. There is also an exceptional support fund for severe financial hardship.

For more information about statutory funding options for postgraduate study, please refer to our article What are the fees and funding options available for postgraduate study? Other sources of financial support for postgraduate students King's offers a wide range of scholarships and funding opportunities for both taught masters and research degrees which may contribute towards tuition fees, living costs or both. \u00a0For more information, please refer to our article What loans, grants or scholarships can I get from King\u2019s?We strongly advise you to secure all your funds for both tuition and living costs for your postgraduate studies before embarking on your course, as there are very few opportunities to access scholarships or hardship funds as a postgraduate student during your course.If you don\u2019t have your funding in place for all your costs, including living costs for you and your family, we encourage you to defer your studies until you have a stable source of income or funding. You may also wish to consider part-time study, which will allow you the time to work and/or claim out of work welfare benefits alongside your studies. Get in touch with the\u00a0Money & Housing Advice team\u00a0for further advice and support. Funding a postgraduate course is a big financial commitment so it is very important that you ensure you have funding in place for the full duration of your studies before you start your course. Finding adequate funding once you have started studying can be very difficult and may lead to financial difficulties.\u00a0 Important to know: University hardship funds cannot assist with tuition fees, and you will be required to demonstrate that you had sufficient funding in place at the outset of your studies. If you are in financial hardship during your course and unable to cover your living costs, we recommend referring to the\u00a0Hardship Funds page\u00a0for more information. International students To gain entry clearance to study in the U.K., many international students need to prove that they have sufficient funds to support themselves and their families whilst in the U.K. Therefore, international students are not permitted to apply for or have no recourse to public funds.However, if you are an EU or International student experiencing unexpected financial difficulties, you may wish to make an application to the International Hardship Fund. To be eligible you must be able to demonstrate you had adequate funding in place at the start of your course, and that 'unforeseen circumstances' have occurred after they started their course leading to financial hardship.To find out more about financial support for international students, please read I\u2019m an International student, what financial support can I access?Important to know: Hardship funds are limited and should not be relied upon to cover all your costs should you lose a critical source of funding. We advise contacting the Money & Housing Advice team to\u00a0discuss your application before you apply. Are there any trusts or charities that can help? There are a large number of UK-based and international trusts and charities that may be able to assist you. However, as each have very specific funding criteria, you will need to do some research before determining who you can apply to.\u00a0 The following websites can help you to get started with your search: Scholarship HubTurn2us grant finderAlternative Guide to Postgraduate FundingBlackbullion funding searchUCAS Additional Funding Guide Funding from these sources is not guaranteed and should not be relied upon for covering the full costs of a degree, but it may assist you with general day-to-day living costs or help out if you find yourself in short-term financial difficulties. To find out more about searching for and applying to trusts and charities, please contact Money & Housing Advice team. Our Advisers can advise you on making applications to trusts and charities, and supply a supporting letter or referral if needed, following an interview to fully establish your personal situation.\u00a0 You may also require a letter of support from an academic, so we advise you to speak to your personal tutor or supervisor to help you.

This year, Ramadan begins around 10\u00a0March 2024\u00a0and ends around 8\u00a0April 2024. What is Ramadan? Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, when the Holy Qur\u2019an was revealed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It\u2019s considered one of the holiest months of the year for Muslims. The month traditionally begins and ends based on the sighting of the new moon. In 2024, the month-long fast of Ramadan begins around 10 March and ends around 8 April. How is it observed? Ramadan is a holy month of religious reflection. Fasting during Ramadan is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. During this month Muslims are encouraged to increase their good deeds, from acts of charity and community engagement to increasing good values such as generosity, solidarity, kindness, patience, and forgiveness. Ramadan is a month of intense spiritual rejuvenation with a heightened focus on devotion, during which Muslims spend extra time reading the Qur\u2019an and performing special prayers. Eid ul-Fitr At the end of Ramadan, Muslims celebrate Eid ul-Fitr, or the 'Festival of the Breaking of the Fast.' This year the holiday is expected to be on 10 April 2023. A special prayer and sermon are held the morning of Eid day, followed by a community celebration usually in a park or large hall. Food, games and presents for children are important parts of the festivities, as friends and family spend the day socialising, eating and reuniting with old acquaintances. The greeting Eid Mubarak means 'blessed holiday!'\u00a0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Staying healthy during Ramadan Exercise & nutrition Students observing fast may find these practical guides to exercise and nutrition during Ramadan useful: Ramadan: Fasting nutrition\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bTraining tips for Ramadan Fasting & health conditions While fasting is compulsory for most Muslims during Ramadan, you may be exempt if you are: Unwell\u00a0Pregnant\u00a0Breastfeeding\u00a0Menstruating\u00a0Travelling\u00a0Elderly Where appropriate, for example if you\u2019ve had your period, you can make up the fast later. If you\u2019re unsure whether it\u2019s safe for you to fast, seek advice from your GP surgery. What to do if you become unwell while fasting The British Islamic Medical Association advises that if you become unwell during Ramadan, you should stop fasting and seek medical advice. You can do this by visiting NHS 111 online or your GP practice\u2019s website. Alternatively, call 111 or your practice directly. How does King\u2019s support Muslim members of the community? Imams & the Chaplaincy If you\u2019d like to discuss your thoughts and approach to Ramadan and fasting during your studies, you can contact our Muslim Chaplains: Imam Abdul Mumin ChoudhuryRomana Kazmi King\u2019s has a range of Chaplains from different faith backgrounds.

(including Dyslexia) Important to know: If you are submitting screening forms after 17 June 2024, we cannot guarantee a Specific Learning Difference assessment will take place in time to make an application for Personalised Assessment Arrangements for Exam Period 3 (August 2024).\u00a0The Screening service will be closed from 09.00 on Friday 21 June 2024 until 5 July 2024. Specific Learning Differences (SpLDs) include Dyslexia, Dyspraxia/Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), Dysgraphia, Dyscalculia, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Dyslexia\u202faffects around 10% of the population and impacts the way individuals process, store and retrieve information. Students with dyslexia may experience difficulties with memory, personal organisation, time management, sequencing,\u202freading and writing. Dyspraxia or Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) is a specific learning difference that can lead to difficulties in terms of time management, personal organisation and planning, and may impair motor/coordination skills. ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder)\u202fcan be identified as a specific learning difference but is usually diagnosed by psychiatry referral via the NHS. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder which has features relating to both specific learning differences and mental health. Symptoms of anxiety can overlap with symptoms of ADHD. I think I have got dyslexia\u00a0or dyspraxia, what should I do? If you think you may have a specific learning difference such as dyslexia or dyspraxia, the first step is to request an initial screening from Disability Support & Inclusion. Screening for specific learning difficulties: Our screening form asks a range of questions to help us decide if specific learning difference may be present. Most questions just require a tick box answer, so the form doesn't take too long to fill out. Next steps: Request a screening questionnaire by emailing Disability Support. Complete the questionnaire and email this back to us. We'll review\u202fyour questionnaire responses and contact you to either: Offer an appointment to discuss your learning challenges in detail, orRefer you directly for a full diagnostic assessment. Important to know: King's will not fund the cost of a diagnostic assessment for final year students within the last 5 months of their course. Diagnostic assessment for Specific Learning Difference (SpLDs) After we have received and reviewed your screening questionnaire, you may be referred to an SpLD assessor for a full diagnostic assessment.A diagnostic assessment will take 3-4 hours and includes an in-depth background interview and a range of tasks and tests related to reading, writing, memory and information processing. The aim of the assessment is not just to provide the individual with a formal diagnosis, but also to explore and understand the person\u2019s pattern of strengths and weaknesses to identify\u00a0the best ways to manage any underlying difficulties. Important to know: ADHD can only be identified as a specific learning difference in these assessments. This is not a medical diagnosis of ADHD. What happens after the assessment? At the end of the assessment, you will be given verbal feedback. The assessor will send a written report to you and also to the Disability Support Team at King\u2019s College London within two weeks of your appointment. On receipt of your written report, you should contact the Disability Support Team\u00a0to arrange an appointment with us to discuss the findings of the report and next steps. These assessments can only be carried out by an Educational Psychologist or a Specialist Teacher Assessor holding a current practicing certificate.\u00a0King\u2019s has partnership arrangements with a number of independent professionals who are fully qualified to assess higher education students for specific learning difficulties. Fees and charges An administration fee of \u00a350 will be charged for all students enrolled at King's (from September 2019 onwards).All other costs (and the full costs for students who joined King\u2019s in 2018-19 or earlier) will be covered by King\u2019s College London.

Important to know: Your HEAR, Final Transcript and Record of Agreed Results documents are all hosted on Gradintelligence.Please don't register yourself for your own account on Gradintelligence. This creates an account which is not linked to your student record and your HEAR won't appear there. King's has automatically created Gradintelligence\u00a0accounts for every graduate since 2012, which is linked to your student record. Where is my HEAR and what format is it in? Your HEAR is an electronic document and is hosted on a website called Gradintelligence or 'Gradintel' as it is commonly called. As a King's student, we have already set up an account for you; all you need to do is activate it to access your HEAR for the first time.To access your HEAR: Activate your account on\u00a0gradintel.com\u00a0using your King's email address.Your HEAR may not be immediately available; the document is only released following the ratification and release of results at academic boards.Once your results have been released, log in to\u00a0gradintel.com.If you have a HEAR available, it will be on the Gradintelligence homepage.Select\u00a0'view my HEAR'\u00a0to view the document.Select\u00a0'share my HEAR'\u00a0to send a secure link for someone else to view the document or print directly from a PDF viewer. What is Gradintel and how does it work? Gradintel is a service and website external to King's which is used by universities in the UK to deliver the HEAR. It is owned by the Tribal Group but the content of your HEAR is supplied and managed by King's and is linked to your student record. When you enrol as a student at King\u2019s, we register you with an account with Gradintel, all ready to fill up your HEAR as you progress through your studies. This means that you don\u2019t need to register yourself on Gradintel \u2013 we\u2019ll do it for you.

If your KCL email account is still active, search your inbox for \u201chear\u201d and you should find it.Your account with Gradintel and your HEAR are free. Important to know: Your Gradintel account is just that \u2013 yours, which means it\u2019s attached to your information. The KCL HEAR team can access your account to update information, but other staff at King\u2019s, including Student Services, can\u2019t access your account. This means your HEAR is not something we can create manually or print out for you. If you ever need a hard copy of your HEAR, you would need to print it yourself \u2013 it comes already stamped. However, it is designed to be used digitally, and this is what we would recommend. What's the best way for me to send my HEAR to employers, institutions, agencies or any other organisation? The HEAR is designed to be used digitally. As such, please only send your HEAR\u00a0via the official \u2018Share\u2019 function on the Gradintel website. This function allows sharing with whomever you need, and you can set access as appropriate to your needs.

If a foreign institution or organisation outside of the UK requires your degree to be verified as an official document from the UK, you can legalise your degree certificate. Your degree certificate becomes a legalised document from the UK once an Apostille stamp\u00a0is attached to it.What\u2019s an Apostille stamp?The Apostille stamp - or Apostille seal - is used to imprint the document with a government crest. An official certificate is attached and accompanies the degree certificate, allowing it to be recognised as a legalised document from the UK. When a document is legalised, this confirms that the original signature, seal and stamp on the document is genuine.How do I turn my degree into a legalised document? It\u2019s very important that you thoroughly read, understand and follow the instructions on the government's website\u00a0for getting your document legalised.Before you submit your application, make sure that your document is eligible for legalisation and meets all of the specified requirements.\u00a0Complete an application to legalise your document with the Legalisation Office.When making an application, you\u2019ll need the following: The documents you want to legaliseA credit or debit cardThe full address that you want your documents returned toAccess to a printer. The Legalisation Office will review the document to check the authenticity of the signature, stamp and seal.\u00a0Once they\u2019ve confirmed that the signature, stamp and seal are genuine, they\u2019ll attach an Apostille stamp to the document and it will become legalised. Guidance on how to apply and the cost of legalising your documents is available on the government's website. Your recipient can check if an Apostille was issued by either the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office or the Legalisation Office through the government's website. Important to know: The Apostille stamp is not supplied by the university. The only competent authority is the Legalisation Office.\u00a0 Legalisation is not required for purposes of UK documents within the UK.

The only results you receive will be confirmed and ratified.Please avoid contacting the university or your department asking to be told your results over the telephone because data protection restrictions don\u2019t allow staff to disclose your results in this way.

For more information about your HEAR and what it contains, please refer to What is the Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR)?For guidance on accessing and using your Gradintelligence account, please refer to How can I access my Gradintelligence account? Verifying the authenticity of your degree If a third party requires verification that your degree and the documents you provide to them are authentic, please use the Higher Education Degree Datacheck (HEDD)\u00a0online verification service. This is an independent database which King\u2019s subscribes to. HEDD offers a centralised system for degree verification that connects employers, agencies, universities, embassies and councils.For a small fee, agencies, organisations or any third party should use this database to verify the information provided on your documents is valid and accurate, and to check if a UK university or college is a recognised degree-awarding body. This database is intended for third party use, rather than for students to check their own information; for this you have your student record and Gradintelligence.For more details about this service, please refer to How can an employer or other agency verify a degree from King\u2019s? Final statement of your degree Your downloadable Completion of Study Letter confirms all the same information as your Degree Certificate and is just a valid and authentic.The main difference is that this letter is available on your student record to download yourself when you need it, but your Degree Certificate is only issued in hard copy and is sent to you by post. If a third party requests your Degree Certificate, your Completion of Study Letter acts as an excellent digital alternative. Your Degree Certificate will only be produced and posted within 3 months of your award date, which means you will need to wait for this. For more details and timelines around when you can expect your Degree Certificate, please refer to Your Degree Certificate. I need to prove my degree in another country If you are going to work or study in another country, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll be asked to provide details of your degree.Different countries often have different measures for degrees and various other qualifications, so it\u2019s possible you\u2019ll need to provide information that makes your degree at King\u2019s understandable to others overseas. If you have an undergraduate or postgraduate taught degree (non-research), the best document to provide is your\u00a0Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR). This document has been designed to make your degree and its classification understandable overseas and includes ECTS credit equivalence.If you need to accompany a document with marking criteria for a third party to understand your results, in addition to your HEAR you may find these resources useful when needing to get your degree validated overseas: Marking: College FrameworkMarking Criteria UndergraduateMarking Criteria Taught Postgraduate I\u2019m looking for a GPA conversion for my results If you\u2019re a King\u2019s graduate or a current student approaching the end of your studies, and you are applying to institutions overseas that require a GPA for your degree, you\u2019ll need to use an external service provider to calculate this conversion \u2013 unfortunately King\u2019s can\u2019t provide this for you.UK ENIC\u00a0is one organisation that provides this service, as does\u00a0WES, which focuses on the US and Canada. However, to be sure you are providing the right documentation and information, we advise checking with the institution are you applying to about conversion resources, since they may have particular organisations they use to verify conversions or equivalences. I\u2019ve finished my studies but I\u2019m still awaiting my results Most undergraduate courses finish in spring in May/June, and most postgraduate taught courses finish at the end of September.It often takes time for results to be released after you have completed all your assessments, which means you can finish your course and still be awaiting results.During this time, it\u2019s likely you will need to prove completion of your course, but this can be difficult if your results haven\u2019t yet been finalised.For more information on what we can provide you with while you wait, please refer to I need to prove I\u2019ve finished my course and am awaiting results.

Currently studying on a Masters course Currently studying on a Student visaApplying for further study in the UK requiring a new Student visaYour current course of study finishes in September and your next course of study is due to start in September or October of that same year (i.e. before you will be awarded for your current course) If this is you, you can request a Pre-Award visa letter from Student Services.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b What is a Pre-Award visa letter? This letter is designed specifically for students on a Student visa applying for further study in the UK, but where the start of the new course of study overlaps with the end of the current course. This can make it difficult to prove your results so you can be admitted onto the new course. This document is designed to bridge that gap. The admissions team at King\u2019s or another institution may ask that you provide a letter confirming you're 'highly likely to succeed' on your current course of study, to support your application for your next course. Student Services can provide this letter for you. First, they'll check if you're eligible for the letter. If you are, they'll seek confirmation from your department directly to confirm you're 'likely to succeed' and pass your course. To request this, please submit a document request form. Important to know: This letter is not the same as predicted grades (which the university isn\u2019t able to provide).If you\u2019re currently studying at different institution and you\u2019ve applied to King\u2019s for your next course, but your official award hasn\u2019t been issued yet, you might need to request the equivalent of our \u2018Pre-award\u2019 letter from your current institution to show our admissions team that you\u2019re highly likely to succeed on your previous course.The offer for your new course and new CAS for your new programme will be issued based on your Pre-Award letter, as the expectation is that you\u2019ll receive the award from your previous course. If you don\u2019t achieve the award your Pre-Award letter was issued for, it could impact your new visa and study on your new course. When I request a Pre-Award visa letter, how long will it take for me to receive it? We aim to resolve all cases within 5 working days. However, these requests are usually made in September, the busiest time of year for Student Services and many other departments across the university. During this period of high demand, requests can take longer than our usual 5 working days to process. If you need this document urgently, please provide all details relevant to your request (including your deadline) to help us process it as quickly as possible. What if I'm not studying on a visa but still applying for a new course? If your next course is due to start immediately after the end of your current course, and you need to show evidence of your results so far and that you are due to graduate, please see our article I need to prove I\u2019ve finished my course and am awaiting results. What if I'm an undergraduate? Undergraduate courses usually end in May/June, and new courses for further usually start in September. Normally, undergraduates get awarded their degrees in July/August, in time for a September start on a new course. The Pre-Award Visa letter is designed for those who are unlikely to be awarded in time for their new course. If you feel your situation falls outside of this, please let us know providing as much information as possible, and we'll do our best to help you.

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01226 Print I don\u2019t want to take a student loan for religious or personal reasons Changes in recent years to student funding and tuition fees in the UK, has meant that you may face difficult considerations around your student debt. Important to know:\u00a0The interest rate changes annually, on 1\u00a0September each year, based on the Retail Price Index (RPI) of the previous March. The interest rate charged is normally the RPI + up to 3%, depending on your circumstances and income once graduated and working. You can find the current interest rate on the Government website. However, during some periods the government may apply an interest cap to ensure students and graduates are not being charged a higher interest rate than the average found in the commercial market.For a variety of reasons some students may choose not to, or may not be able to take out the\u00a0Tuition Fee\u00a0loan or the\u00a0Maintenance Fee\u00a0loan, including for religious reasons. In this article: What are the current religious perspectives on taking out a loan?Are there alternatives sources of funding?Are there bursaries or scholarships that can support me?What else can I do? What are the current religious perspectives on taking out a loan? For many Muslim students this is an issue; you may choose not to take out the loan as you\u2019re required to pay interest with the loan \u2013 which is seen as forbidden in Islam. There are currently 3 different opinions on the matter by Islamic scholars. Should not be allowed Interest (riba) is the student loan and therefore, any transactions with regards to it is strictly forbidden.If there was the possibility of having a loan without incurring interest, then it would certainly be acceptable. Allowed Student loans don\u2019t necessarily fit the definition of a loan from an Islamic perspective. In order for you to be given a loan you must \u201cbe given ownership\u201d of the money. This is clearly not the case with the Tuition Fee loan, as it is paid directly to the university.The prohibition of interest-based loans is partly due to the burden of the loan falling back on the family, if the person taking it on is unable to pay it back. However, in the case of student loans if you are unable to pay back the loan, it will be written off.You don\u2019t need to start paying back the loan until you earn a salary of \u00a325,000 per year. Want vs need Some scholars believe there is just no clear-cut line on whether a loan is acceptable or not. You will have to weigh up whether further education is a need or a want on your own. In some cases, university can be seen as a \u2018want\u2019 \u2013 it is not essential to living a fulfilling life.However, it could be considered that if every Muslim opted out of university due to the high costs, this would be harmful to the wider community. Education is linked to many areas of life, including better health and lower crime rates.This perspective has led to the belief that if you tried your best to find halal funding and have been unable to, then it could be acceptable to take out a loan. We would however advise seeking out the opinion of a knowledgeable scholar before doing so.

Self-funding Home and EU undergraduate students that self-fund their degrees have the option to pay their tuition fee in two instalments: one at the end of October and the other at the end of January. However, if more time is needed to pay, both instalments can be paid simultaneously by 31 January.You can find more information about paying fees in our article\u00a0Paying your tuition fees at King\u2019s.If you are having difficulties meeting the fee deadline, don\u2019t struggle alone, please\u00a0read I'm having money difficulties, where can I find support? National Zakat Foundation (NZF) You could try a Zakat\u00a0where family and community members pay their Zakat to you for your tuition fee to by-pass the interests.\u00a0 You can find more information about the various funds offered and how to apply by visiting The National Zakat Foundation.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b COSARAF The COSARAF Charitable Foundation award hardship funds to undergraduate Muslim home students in financial need. The Scholars\u2019 Hardship Fund provides grants of up to \u00a32,000 per annum, with most grants being between \u00a3500-\u00a31,000. The application deadline is in late October each year and you can find out more by looking at their guidance. Other funding providers These are some other external alternative funding providers, some of which offer sharia-compliant banking for students, are: Al Rayan BankAnsar Finance Important to know: Please be aware of the university\u2019s policy around funding and not taking up student loans. Please refer to Students who choose not to take Student Loans for detail. Are there bursaries or scholarships that can support me? There's a range of bursaries and scholarships offered by King\u2019s and other institutions. This is a great way to obtain more money without interests. If you're a British Muslim, you can apply for the Aziz Foundation Scholarship. The Foundation\u00a0offers 100% tuition fee scholarships to British Muslims who want to take postgraduate taught (PGT) courses at UK universities, including King\u2019s. If you're planning to take a PGT course during the academic year 2023-24, the deadline to apply is Friday 30 June 2023. You can find more information about the scholarship on the Aziz Foundation's\u00a0scholarships webpage. Even if you don\u2019t take out a loan for religious reasons, it\u2019s still possible to receive the\u00a0Kings\u2019 Living Bursary, which you are not required to pay back and could help towards paying your some of your fees and towards your cost of living. You can learn more about the bursaries and scholarships offered at King's by reading our article\u00a0What loans, grants or scholarships can I get from King's?Important to know: If you think you might be eligible, you will still need to apply for the Maintenance Loan from Student Finance to be apply for the King\u2019s Living Bursary.However, this doesn\u2019t mean you still have to take out a loan; all you have to do is simply request \u00a30 as a loan.This process allows the university to assess your household income, which is required to apply for the bursary, and they will usually obtain this information from Student Finance.Make sure you remember to agree to have your details shared with the university when you apply.If you have any concerns or wish to discuss this, contact with the Money & Housing Advice Team. What else can I do? These are areas to consider when calculating your costs, with advice on how to maximise your budget and support yourself financially. Accommodation The largest proportion of your expenditure as a student will be on rent. The\u00a0London rent map\u00a0shows you the most affordable areas to live. Cheaper areas are generally further from the university, so you have to balance the cost of rent with the cost of travel expenses.Our article Travelling to campus & around London\u00a0contains useful information on student travel discounts.\u00a0That said, there are certain areas in central London that are affordable \u2013 you might just have to be a little persistent when trying to find a place. Check out our article I need help finding somewhere to live for support and guidance.A possible alternative to living out, would be to live at home whilst studying in university. Of course, not everyone has this option, but if you do, it is worth considering. This would mean that you would save money by paying less or no rent than you would if you moved out. However, there would still be costs incurred by living at home due to transport costs.These can be minimised by using a\u00a016-25 travelcard or a student oyster\u00a0card if you have a term-time London address.If you choose to live in Kings\u2019 Residences, it may be worth considering the\u00a0Kings\u2019 Affordable Accommodation Scheme\u00a0which can help minimise the costs of rent. Work One of the most popular ways to support yourself financially is to secure a job and save up for university so that you don\u2019t need a loan. You may also consider a gap year or two before starting university. If you get work before starting university, a good relationship with your employer could mean that you are able to continue working part-time through university.Working alongside your studies is another option, and income can also be supplemented in other ways, such as by participating in university research studies or completing online surveys.For more information and guidance on working alongside your studies, please read I want to get a job while studying.

If you are accepted onto an intercalation year at King\u2019s, we will uphold the fee status assessment made at\u00a0the point of entry to your programme (at King\u2019s or another institution). Will my fees be reassessed if I\u00a0intercalate\u00a0at another institution? Students\u00a0registered on a Medical or\u00a0Dental\u00a0programme can choose to intercalate either at King\u2019s or at another institution. If you choose to intercalate outside King\u2019s, we recommend you check with the institution you\u00a0are intending to intercalate with to understand how they will assess your fee status. If you do intercalate outside King\u2019s, when you re-join your programme at King\u2019s\u00a0no fee reassessment will be made.\u00a0Your fee status will be\u00a0the same as when you began your programme. Will my fee status be reassessed\u00a0if I choose\u00a0to defer my studies? If you were made an offer but deferred that offer prior to having enrolled, you would not be considered as\u00a0an\u00a0EU national who started a higher education course in England in the 2020/21 academic year (or before), and therefore would be subject to the regulations implemented\u00a0when you are about to enrol.

This article is for EU/EEA or Swiss students who are starting a course from September 2023 onwards. If you're continuing a course that started before September 2021, please read our article I am an EU/EAA/Swiss student/applicant who enrolled in 2020/21 or before; What is my fee status? Some EU/EEA and Swiss students are entitled to the home rate of tuition fees and may be eligible for Student Finance funding to help with their fees and living costs. Others may be assessed for the international rate of fees. The type of support you\u2019ll receive will be dependent on how long you have lived in the UK or EEA, and/or whether you or a family member have been working in the UK. What is UK Student Funding & do I qualify for it? There are two types of funding available from UK Student Finance: tuition fee loans and maintenance loans/grants. EU nationals and some EEA and Swiss nationals may be eligible for one or both sources of funding, depending on their circumstances. The rules are complex, so we recommend you check with Student Finance England\u202fto see what you\u2019re eligible for. Student Finance will take several factors into account when assessing your eligibility. These will include: Whether you\u2019ve studied at degree level before, including in another country\u00a0Whether you have relevant family members If you\u2019d like more guidance about funding criteria, get in touch with our Money & Housing Advice team. Important to know: There is a separate funding application process for students who are currently living in Northern Ireland, Wales or Scotland. Tuition fee loans What is the tuition fee loan? The EU tuition fee loan for undergraduate study (for full-time or part-time courses) covers all or some of your course fee. It\u2019s paid directly to the university. You have to start paying the loan back once you\u2019ve finished studying and are earning over a certain threshold. The Postgraduate Master's loan is available for postgraduate degree courses (full-time or part-time). It\u2019s paid directly to you so you can choose to use it towards your fees or for your living costs. Am I eligible for the tuition fee loan? If you\u2019re an EU national, you\u2019re eligible provided the following two conditions are met: You hold EU Pre-Settled or Settled Status; and You have lived in the UK, Gibraltar, EEA or Switzerland for the three consecutive years immediately before the first day of the first academic year of your course (1 September or 1 January). This doesn\u2019t include temporary absences such as holidays If you\u2019re an Irish national, you can qualify for the Tuition Fee Loan as long as you've been living in the UK and/or Ireland, or the EU/EEA, or the British Overseas or Overseas Territories, for the past 3 years. Maintenance loans What are maintenance loans? Maintenance loans are designed to help you cover your living costs while you\u2019re studying, including essentials like rent and food. They\u2019re paid directly into your bank account. You have to start paying the loan back once you\u2019ve finished studying and are earning over a certain threshold. The amount of maintenance loan you\u2019re entitled to will depend on a range of factors, including your financial and family circumstances. If you're a full-time student who has a child or an adult dependent who depends on you, you may be eligible for extra financial help. Please read Student finance for undergraduates: Extra help for more information. Am I eligible for a maintenance loan? If you\u2019re from the EU/EEA or Switzerland and are applying for an undergraduate degree, you may be eligible for the maintenance loan (and grants, where applicable) as well as the tuition fee loan. In order to qualify, you must: Have EU Settled Status Have not lived outside the UK for three years before (and including) the start of your course, normally 1 September or 1 January Have no significant gaps in your UK and Islands residency Provide evidence of all the above You may also qualify for the maintenance loan (and grants) if Student Finance consider you to be living in the UK as a Migrant Worker.

Once you have EU Settled Status, you can apply for full Student Finance funding (a tuition fee loan and a maintenance loan) for the next academic year. You will also need to meet all the other eligibility criteria. Does my nationality and/or Settled Status qualify me for the 'home' rate of fees? Home fees are charged at a lower rate than international ones. We follow UK government regulations and guidelines about which students are permitted to pay home fees. We\u2019ll assess your fee status after we receive your course application. We\u2019ll ask you several questions when you apply to help us assess whether you're eligible for home or international fees. You might also need to complete a Fee Status Questionnaire.

Students who are already studying a degree before August / September 2023 should check the eligibility rules as explained on the UKCISA website, as this may differ to the guidance detailed below. For more information, visit UKCISA. What does forced migrant mean? We use the term 'forced migrant' as an umbrella term for the following immigration backgrounds. Refugee\u202fis a former asylum-seeking person who has been granted refuge in a country other than their home country. They have been able to prove that if they are returned home, they will be prosecuted because of their race, religion, nationality, social group or political opinion.\u00a0Humanitarian Protection\u202fis given to people, if sent back, who would face punishment due to a previously unmentioned case.\u00a0Asylum Seeker\u202fis someone who has lodged an application for protection on the basis of the Refugee Convention or Article 3 of the ECHR.\u00a0Limited Leave to Remain is given for applicants with unique cases to remain in the UK for a limited period of time. This could include Discretionary Leave to Remain, or Leave outside the Rules.\u00a0\u00a0Unaccompanied asylum-seeking child\u202fstatus is given in unique cases for children arriving to the country separated from their parents, for a limited period of time, usually until they turn 17.5. What will my fee status be for my degree, and can I receive Student Finance funding as a forced migrant? We recommend that all applicants research their fees and funding entitlement before enrolling on their degree course at King\u2019s, otherwise you may become liable for tuition fees and possible residences costs without any means to pay them. \u00a0\u00a0Tuition Fee Status\u00a0The fee status criteria is provided under the Fees regulations and guidance and published by the governments in England and the three devolved nations. Different criteria will be applied depending on which country you are living in.\u00a0\u00a0Your tuition fee status and Student Finance funding entitlement is assessed separately. Your fee status will be assessed by King\u2019s during the admissions application process. Whether you receive \u2018home\u2019 or \u2018overseas\u2019 fee status will depend on many different factors, such as your immigration status, your UK residency and how long you have lived in the UK. \u00a0\u00a0You can read more about guidance for home fees on the UKCISA website. Student Finance funding eligibility \u00a0Broadly the eligibility rules are the same for Student Finance funding purposes, but you may be expected to submit more detailed evidence to support your application and stricter rules sometimes can be applied.\u00a0\u00a0Please note that if you previously studied\u202fa degree level course in the UK or overseas, or if you hold an equivalent qualification, your Student Finance entitlement will be affected. Please contact the Money & Housing Advice Service [MHAS]\u00a0f you would like to discuss your situation in more detail. \u00a0\u00a0You can read more about the eligibility for Student Finance funding on Student Finance for Undergraduates. I am an Asylum Seeker who is waiting for a decision from the Home Office, can I be Home for fees and receive any Student Finance funding?\u200b\u200b\u200b If you're an Asylum Seeker living in the UK and the Home Office are yet to make decision on your asylum claim, you are likely to be assessed as an \u2018overseas\u2019 student for fees purposes.\u00a0This also means that you will not be able to access Student Finance funding. You would be expected to pay the course tuition fee yourself, unless you receive a successful outcome from the Sanctuary Scholarship. Please do consider your funding options carefully before enrolling on your course. I already hold Refugee Status, Humanitarian Protection, Calais Leave, Stateless Leave, Section 67 Leave, Leave as a Victim of Domestic Violence, or Leave under one of the Afghan or Ukraine Schemes, can I be Home for fees and receive Student Finance?\u00a0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b To be considered for the \u2018home\u2019 rate of tuition fee and to be eligible for Student Finance funding for the duration of your course, you must be ordinarily resident the UK on the first day of the first academic year of your course and have been granted one of the above statuses or humanitarian protection by this date. For courses that start in August or September, the first day of the first academic year is defined as 1 September, for postgraduate courses that start in January it is 1 January.\u00a0In some situations, spouses and children of a person granted one of the above statuses can also qualify for \u2018home\u2019 fees.\u00a0\u00a0You may also want to check if you qualify for \u2018home\u2019 fees from 1 August 2024 if you are a victim of domestic violence or abuse. You can read more about this on the UKCISA website. \u00a0\u00a0Please read more about all these different types of leaves and the eligibility criteria on the UKCISA website. What if I am granted a different immigration status partway through my degree course? If you're awarded one of these above statuses (such as Refugee Status or Indefinite leave to Remain) after the relevant date, partway through a year of your course, you may be eligible to receive some Student Finance funding for your course, and may become eligible to pay the \u2018home\u2019 rate of tuition fee from the start of the next academic year. The rules can depend on when you started your degree, so please contact MHAS if you have questions around your eligibility. What if I am granted Discretionary Leave / Leave outside the Rules (LOTR), or Limited Leave to Remain (through a category such as Right to Family Life)? If you have been already living in the UK continuously for a significant period, and the Home Office grants you Discretionary Leave or another type of Limited Leave to Remain immigration permission in the UK, please consult MHAS if you need further advice on your fee status or Student Finance eligibility. \u00a0\u00a0There may be a possibility that you can access \u2018home\u2019 fee status and Student Finance funding through the Long Residence category. The rules around this category are complex and you need to ensure you have been ordinarily resident in the UK lawfully for three years preceding the start of your course. You can read more about the Long Residence category on the UKCISA website. What about the new rules for students who are assessed as \u2018overseas\u2019 for fees then acquire Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) during the course?\u00a0\u200b\u200b There has been a recent change for students who are granted Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) during their course. This change indicates that students can become \u2018home\u2019 for fees and become eligible for Student Finance funding in a subsequent academic year following their ILR status. This only applies for academic years on or after September 2024. It has now been agreed that a student must be settled on the \u201cfirst day of the academic year\u201d and not the \u201cfirst day of the first academic year of the course\u201d \u2013 this is different to previous academic years and some students may benefit from this new rule. What about when I have gained British citizenship?\u00a0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b If you (or a relevant family member has) Refugee Status and you (or they) are considering applying for British citizenship, this could affect your fees status and/ or your eligibility for Student Finance funding.\u00a0When a refugee obtains a new nationality, eg when a refugee gains British citizenship, their Refugee Status is cancelled, which means a student would have to ensure they qualify for \u2018home\u2019 fees and Student Finance funding in a different category. Please seek advice from MHAS\u00a0for guidance around this. Where can I access more support or information? If you are from a forced migration background and you would like more information about the support available at King\u2019s, please contact\u202fpriority-groups@kcl.ac.uk.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, this a list of useful links where you can find more information about support and advice for forced migrants: We Belong\u202fprovides advocacy, support and assistance to young people in difficulty; particularly those in trouble with the law and at risk of exclusion from school.\u00a0\u00a0Schwab & Westheimer Trust: The trust\u202fprovide grants and scholarships for young asylum seekers and refugees in education.

This is a read only version of the page. Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-02076 Print What welfare benefits can I claim during my studies? Welfare benefits are payments given by the government to certain people on low incomes, or to meet specific needs. This article provides information on the main benefits King's students can claim. More information on all the different benefit is available by visiting the GOV UK: Benefits webpage. What different types of benefits are available? There are many different types of benefits. Some are means-tested and are awarded because of household income and savings. Others are awarded because of personal circumstances or specific needs. Universal Credit Universal credit(UC) is a payment to help with living costs. It is designed to support low-income households, regardless of whether you are in or out of work. Most full-time students cannot apply for Universal Credit, but there are some exceptions. Please read I am a full-time student. Can I claim benefits? for more information. The Money & Housing Advice team can provide further advice on Universal Credit (UC), including how much eligible students should receive. This will be based on individual circumstances and any student income. Further information is also available from the GOV UK: Universal Credit webpage. Important to know: Making a claim for Universal Credit will end some existing welfare benefit claims, so please seek advice before claiming if you already receive other benefits. Personal Independence Payment Personal Independence Payment(PIP) is a benefit for people who have long-term health issues or disabilities which affect their mobility and/or their ability to manage daily living activities such as preparing food, washing and dressing. Full-time and part-time students can claim PIP. PIP is not means tested and therefore other income/savings will not affect your entitlement to PIP benefits. The\u00a0can Money & Housing Advice team\u00a0offer further advice on PIP and can offer support with all aspects of the claims process. For more information on PIP, please visit the GOV UK: Personal Independence Payment webpage. Carers Allowance Carers Allowance (CA) is a benefit for people who are giving regular and substantial care to someone who is in receipt of a disability benefit. If you are a part-time student, studying 21 hours or less per week, then you may be able to claim CA benefits. You can find more information on CA by visiting the GOV UK: Carer\u2019s Allowance webpage. Other means-tested benefits There are other means-tested benefits which students may be eligible to receive, such as Child Tax Credit and Housing Benefit. It is not currently possible to make a new claim for these benefits. If you have an existing claim and would like information or advice on your eligibility or entitlement as a student, please contact the Money & Housing Advice team. I am a full-time student. Can I claim benefits? Most full-time students, including those who are interrupting their studies, won\u2019t be eligible to apply for means-tested welfare benefits such as Universal Credit. However, there are some exceptions. Full-time students may be able to claim if they: Have dependent children\u00a0Are disabled, were assessed as having limited capability for work before starting their course and are in receipt of a qualifying disability benefit\u00a0Have a non-student partner\u00a0Have a student partner who is eligible to claim Universal Credit\u00a0Have taken time out from their course because of illness and have now recovered and are not eligible for a student loan while waiting to rejoin the course\u00a0Have taken time out from their course because of caring responsibilities which have now ended and are not eligible for a student loan while waiting to rejoin the course Important to know: in all cases, you are still required to meet the usual benefit eligibility criteria. If any of the above conditions apply to you, please contact the Money & Housing Advice Team for more information on making a claim. I am a part-time student. Can I claim benefits? As a part-time student, you may be eligible for means-tested benefits, such as Universal Credit. You must meet the wider eligibility \u2013 for Universal Credit, for example, this will mean being able to show that your course is compatible with any \u2018work-related requirements\u2019 attached to your claim. I already have a welfare benefit claim, will my claim be impacted by my student status and funding? If you are in receipt of benefits before coming to King\u2019s, you must inform the relevant office when you become a student as eligibility and entitlement amounts may change.\u202fFailure to inform the relevant office may lead to an overpayment occurring or even a benefits fraud investigation. Important to know: Parts of your Maintenance loan, or postgraduate loan for PG students, count as income and will reduce the amount of means-tested benefits that you are entitled to during term time. Benefit awards are reassessed for the summer vacation period. Some students do not apply for their maintenance loan as they think it will affect their benefits. However, your benefits will be calculated as though you have claimed all the available funding, whether you have claimed this or not. Certain courses attract other types of funding which may affect welfare benefit claims \u2013 please contact the Money & Housing Advice team for advice on this. Some types of student funding do not affect benefit claims, for example tuition fee loans and grants for dependents such as the Parent\u2019s Learning Allowance and Childcare Grant, available from SFE. However, you must declare all student income (and other income) to the Department for Work and Pensions or relevant benefit agencies so that your situation can be fully assessed. I have a disability or long-term illness. Can I claim disability benefits? If you meet the disability and general entitlement criteria, you can claim Personal Independence Payment(PIP), whether you are in full-time or part-time education. This is assessed on how well you can complete certain tasks, such as preparing food, washing and bathing and planning and following journeys. For more information on disability benefits and their criteria, please visit the GOV UK: Personal Independence Payment webpage. You can also read our article: What funding support is available for disabled students? When do I need to apply? It is important that you claim PIP straight away if you think you are entitled, as there are no provisions for backdating.\u00a0 Call the claim line on 0800 917 2222. Your PIP application form will be date stamped on the day that you call. I'm having time off my studies. Can I still apply for benefits? If you are on a full-time course, you will continue to be treated as a full-time student for benefits purposes. You will not usually be eligible for means-tested benefits, such as Universal Credit, unless you fall within one of the exceptions. If you need to take a break from your studies because of ill health or caring responsibilities, you can make a Universal Credit claim once you have recovered, or your caring responsibilities have ended. This can last until you go back to your studies, or for 12 months, whichever is shorter. Will my immigration status affect my ability to claim? Many welfare benefits cannot be claimed by people who are subject to immigration conditions. If you are in the UK on a student visa or have any other type of limited leave to remain in the UK, claiming welfare benefits could be a breach of your immigration conditions.\u00a0\u00a0If your immigration status includes \u2018no recourse to public funds\u2019 as a condition, you can\u2019t claim most welfare benefits, though there are some exceptions.\u00a0If you are an EU student, with a status under the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS), please seek further advice on whether you are eligible to apply for benefits. Important to know: You should always seek advice before making any claims. Please speak to our team of Specialist International Advisers who can offer support and guidance to all international students. For information on alternative funding opportunities, read our article I'm an international student, what financial support can I access. I'm a student with a partner, does that change things? If you are a full-time student and you live with a partner who is not a student, they may be able to claim means-tested benefits for you both. Your student support may be taken into account in any claims. Navigating welfare benefits can be complex, and this article is meant as a general overview only. If you would like further clarification or advice, please contact our Money and Housing Advice Team. Alternatively, you can contact an external advice agency.

Navigating the Student Fee Statement page How can I find my outstanding transaction and view all transactions? To view only invoices with balances owing and payments not yet allocated to your invoice, then select the \u201cOutstanding Transactions\u201d option in the drop down next to \u201cStatement Type\u201d. Your view will automatically default to this option when you open your statement. Depending on how many years you have studied at King\u2019s and how many transactions you have on your student account, you may prefer to use this view as it gives you a much shorter list to review. How can I view all my transactions? If you prefer to see all transactions, regardless of whether there are any balances owing, then you can select the \u201cAll Transactions\u201d option in the drop down next to \u201cStatement Type\u201d.To change the view, simply select your preference followed by the \u201cApply\u201d button.You can also filter your view using the \u201cYears\u201d option below Statement Type, which will show you transactions posted from August to July of the academic year you select. If you have made a payment such as a deposit for a tuition fee in advance of the next academic year, you may prefer to keep this filter empty as the default, so you can view everything. How can I find my transactions and those of my sponsor? The \u201cFee Statement\u201d page shows you a list of all invoices and credits issued: To you: These can be found on the tab called Your Transaction.To your external sponsor: These can be found on the tab called External Sponsor Transactions.Internal, e.g. discounts, studentships: These can be found on the tab called Internal Sponsor Transactions. If you cannot see your invoice, then it is likely it has not yet been issued. You can visit the KCL: When To Pay My Fees for information on when you will be invoiced.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Making payments & receiving statements After scrolling through your transactions, you will find two buttons at the bottom of the page. The first of these buttons is How to make a payment and this will take you through to our payment website, where you can find information on the different types of payment methods available, with links to make a payment through the approved payment pathways. The second button, allows you to download a PDF of either: A full statement of all transactions, or;A statement showing only the outstanding transactions The type of statement available is determined by the \u201cStatement Type\u201d view you have selected at the top of the page. What are the different transaction types? Where relevant, you will also see a list of any payments (receipts), any refunds, any journals and any re-scheduled fees. Invoices You will be able to see your college Tuition and Residence Fee invoices. Where the invoice has been issued to you, then you will be able to download a PDF copy of the invoice. Important to know: The invoice will not reflect any payments or any credit notes issued to you. Your invoice is not a statement. For an up-to-date view of your balance owing, you should review your fee statement. If you are being sponsored for your university fees, you will not be given the option to download a copy of the invoice on the \u201cexternal transactions\u201d tab, as the invoice will have already been sent by email to your sponsor. Receipts This relates to payments received by the college towards your fees. These could be card or bank transfer. If you require a copy of the receipt, you can click on the \u2018download\u2019 button to the far right of the transaction for a PDF copy. Journal This is normally an accounting term. A journal can be a credit (a \u2018minus\u2019 amount) onto your account or a debit (a \u2018plus\u2019 amount) and can cover many different scenarios. For example, it may be to clear a very small payment shortfall (credit), or a funding award or expense refund (credit). Re-scheduled due date Another common reason that you will see a journal is when the Credit Control department have agreed to re-schedule your invoice due dates and/or split your fees into additional instalments. In such cases, you will see a credit (a \u2018minus\u2019 amount) to reverse the original invoice(s) and another journal (a \u2018plus\u2019 amount) for each of the new instalments you have been given. Refunds If you have overpaid the university, then we may need to refund this balance to you. If you believe you are due a refund, then there are further instructions on how to apply for this on the bottom of your fee statement page. Fund This is typically where you have or are due to be paid a sum of money by the university. There are many different reasons for a student to be paid a \u201cFund\u201d; for example, an expense claim refund, a hardship award, a maintenance grant, a King\u2019s Living Bursary payment or a monthly stipend. Important to know: If you see an amount other than \u00a30 in the balance column on transaction with a type of \u201cFund\u201d, then this is a sum due to be paid directly to you. It will not be offset to any Tuition or Residence Fees unless you have given permission to Credit Control to do so. You should therefore ensure that you have responded to the request from King\u2019s to provide your UK bank account details that the sum is to be paid to, by completing the online task in your student records called \u201cFund Payments, Expenses and Support Grants\u201d in the \u201cMy Bank Details \u2013 Payment to students\u201d container.

What is Global-Pay for Students (GPfS)? GPfS is a payment platform hosted by Convera. The platform offers students transparency over exchange rates and a range of international debit and credit card payment options in their local currency in over 135 countries. GPfS also provides bank transfer options in both local and domestic currencies in almost 150 different countries. Why are GBP payments with a non-UK-issued card expensive to process? Converting money from one currency to another is a relatively low-cost task for a financial services provider.However, transferring that money across a country border is very expensive for the end recipient who\u2019s paying the cost of the transfer. Foreign currency exchange providers often charge a foreign exchange margin to cover the costs of these transactions.Our partner Convera offers you multiple competitively priced alternative payment options through GPfS, including bank transfers and other real time options.Important to know: This does not\u00a0impact pound sterling (GBP) payments with cards issued in the United Kingdom.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b How can I pay my tuition/residence fee using GPfS? We strongly recommend that you avoid converting your local currency into GBP and loading it on to a credit card issued outside of the UK, and instead either: Convert and deposit your GBP funds into an accessible bank account where you can make your payment to King\u2019s College via an international bank transfer on GPfS (making sure you familiarise yourself with any associated transfer costs that your bank/a third party may charge) or Make your payment using one of the alternative local currency options provided on GPfS Check out our article How to pay my fees to learn about the different payment options available on the platform and the processes you need to complete. I need help, who can I contact? If you need further help or support with your payment through the GPfS platform, feel free to contact our Credit Control team.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Important to know: King's will never request your bank details by phone or email.

This is a read only version of the page. Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01910 Print How does King\u2019s spend its income? King's invests its income in a variety of areas, all geared towards supporting education and research. Our financial information pages show how our income is spent in a financial year which runs from 1 August to 31 July, in the following areas: Academic department costs: all staff, equipment and day-to-day costs in academic departments.Academic service costs: learning facilities for students such as Library and central IT infrastructure.Staff and student facilities: for example mental health services, the careers centre, and sports facilities.Central administration and services: for example Human Resources, Finance and Admissions.Premises: all estates and facilities costs, including academic spaces.General education expenditure: for example student recruitment and scholarships.Residence and catering operations.Research grants and contract. Tuition fees Tuition fees are the largest source of income year on year for the university, much like other institutions in the sector. Money received from tuition fees accounts for around half of all income received by King's annually, with around 15% of our total income coming from home undergraduate fees. How are my tuition fees set? Domestic tuition fees are capped by the Government, there are also externally set limits on the number of clinical students to manage the demand for NHS clinical placements. Fees for international students and for postgraduate courses are set by the university and reviewed annually. They are based on the cost to deliver the course, demand and any publicly available competitor information. Why are domestic fees lower than international fees? Fees for undergraduate international students are higher than those paid by their home counterparts. The cost of teaching home students is partly funded by various government sources. Our teaching for home students is funded partly by the UK Government giving us a set amount for teaching each student, topping up the home fee charged. We do not receive government funding for any of our international students, the higher fee charged covers the full unsubsidised cost of their education. Are my tuition fees spent ethically? King's specifically invests in funds that proactively screen to avoid controversial and unethical sectors and industries. We invest in funds that actively target positive social and green investments. King's has no exposure to tobacco producers or fossil fuels, through these funds or any other endowment investment activity. We also hold no investment in any forms involved in controversial weapons. What other income sources does King's have? King's derives its income from a variety of sources alongside tuition fees. These include Research grants and contracts, funding body grants, donations and endowments, investment income and other incomes sources.

You are expected to pay their university fees using one of the three payment methods advertised on our\u00a0How To Pay\u00a0webpage. How do I know if you have received my payment? You can check to see if a payment has been received and has been allocated to the fee invoice, by logging onto their\u00a0Student Records, personal finances page. Depending on the payment method, it takes different lengths of time to reflect. Online debit / credit card payments: should reflect within 2 working days of the payment being made.Bank Transfer in Pound Sterling (GBP): should reflect within 3 working days of payment being made through Global Pay for Students.International Bank Transfers: should reflect within 5 working days, but please note this is dependent on whether an intermediary bank has been used to transfer the funds to King's College London. If your payment does not reflect after this period of time, then we would invite you to notify the credit control department of your payment and the respective payment details by completing the following\u00a0form. How do I obtain a receipt? If you made your payment online, a receipt will be emailed to the email address entered during the payment process within a few minutes of your payment being successful.

How long should I wait to receive my refund? Regrettably, in most instances we are not able to provide you with a precise length of time which you will need to wait to receive your refund, however, please read the following to obtain a better understanding of the timelines involved. UK Refunds: On the basis that the credit is reflecting on your account to be refunded, once we have received the completed request from you, we would normally try our best to process the refund within 7-10 days. However, if the credit is not reflecting on your student account, Credit Control will not be able to proceed with your request until such a time as the invoice amendments, Rebate or Booking deposit are reflecting on your student account. Non-UK Refunds: Once you have submitted your request via the online task and provided\u00a0all\u00a0details requested by Western Union Business Solutions, the Credit Control department will then make checks to ensure that you are entitled to the refund. We are only able to release the refund on the basis that the credit is reflecting on your student account and the refund is due. From that point the time frames are dependent on Western Union Business Solutions having received all required information to process the refund into your non-UK bank account and the country which the payment is being remitted to. Card Refunds If the funds have been returned to the original card, the student will be notified by email at the point the refund has been initiated. Please then allow around 14 days for the funds to credit the respective card. If you have reason to believe that the refund has failed, please contact\u00a0credit.control@kcl.ac.uk\u00a0but DO NOT provide card details in your email for security reasons. Tuition Deposit Refunds The deposit allows applicants, i.e., offer holders to demonstrate their commitment to attend their chosen programme of study at KCL.Payments made toward a tuition fee deposit are generally not refundable if the offer holder chooses not to enrol or is otherwise unable to enrol for reasons within the offer holder\u2019s reasonable control. If you have questions about tuition fees deposit refund, you should be directed to\u00a0King's Admissions. Why have I been invoiced instead of my Sponsor / Student Loans Company (SFE) / NHS? You must provide King's College London with a DfES award letter, Financial Notification award or valid sponsor letter to enable us to bill another corporate body for your fees. Without this document, you will be recorded as a 'self-funding' student and will be sent an invoice and expected to pay yourself. Where do I obtain a copy of my Award Letter / Financial Notification Letter? You should contact Student Finance England or DfES for this document and then provide a copy to the\u00a0Credit Control\u00a0department via email.

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01962 Print I'm having trouble processing my card payment for my fees Troubleshooting card payment issues\u00a0\u00a0Whilst students are expected to pay in advance of any impending fee due dates, we appreciate that complications can arise when attempting to make your card payment. In March 2022, a new global multi factor authentication protocol (3D Secure V2) for online card payments was introduced, which in October 2022 formally replaced the original 3S Secure V1. This document explains what 3D Secure V2 is intended to help you to work through any challenges you may encounter when trying to pay by card.\u00a0What is 3D Secure V2?\u00a0\u00a0This is a multi-factor authentication protocol used to digitally confirm the identity of the payer during checkout. In order for your card issuer to approve your online payment, they may ask the cardholder to provide some data. This may be in the form of the card issuer asking you to provide a pass code they have sent you to authenticate the transaction or biometrics such as face recognition or a fingerprint. For more information visit Visa or MasterCard.\u00a0I have attempted to pay online but have received the message 'Authorisation has failed' or 3D \"Secure challenge authenticated failed\". Why is this?\u00a0\u00a0There are several reasons why this may have happened: IF you may have made a mistake entering the card number THEN try payment again and check all information is accurate. IF there is an issue with the card itself\u00a0THEN you should contact your bank. IF your billing address contains an invalid character, such as a /, -, () or : THEN you should try payment again and remove all characters from your billing address. IF the postcode you have entered is different from the postcode held by the card issuing company THEN check the information held by your bank is up to date and they have all your contact details which could impact authentication, then attempt payment again and check all information is accurate. IF your credit limit may have been exceeded, an overall credit limit by some card issuers may impose daily limits on the amount and the number of payments you can attempt THEN you should contact your bank and ask for clarification on any limits which may exist for online payments. You must ensure your bank / card issuer is aware in advance of your intention to make an online card payment. Not all cards are eligible for online payments, payments using Visa, Mastercard are allowed THEN you should use another card. IF an error message of unable to authenticate appears THEN you should contact your card issuer or bank to confirm that the cardholder is set-up correctly to allow for an SCA (Strong Customer Authentication) transaction. Important to know:\u00a0If the card has been declined the student may try again, but please be aware that most card issuers allow only three consecutive attempts before the card is blocked for the rest of the day. In order to maintain confidentiality, the card issuing company will not tell the University why the transaction has been declined and the student will need to contact them directly to find out why it was declined.\u00a0Additional troubleshooting methods to try:\u00a0If your payment has failed and it does not appear to be related to authentication, you may want to try other methods which may help.

If you are looking to share with others, make sure you talk about finances before you begin your search.In this article: RentBillsEnergy Performance Certificate (EPC)Council Tax Insurance TV Licence Broadband, phone and TV packages RentBe realistic about what you can afford to pay and stick to your budget when house-hunting. If sharing with friends, check how much everyone can afford before you start looking. There is nothing worse than finding the perfect property, only for someone to pull out when they realise they cannot afford it or worse find that they are unable to keep up with rent payments once they are committed to a contract.BillsAlways check with the landlord if any bills are included in the rent, or try to get an idea of how much extra you will have to pay if these are your responsibility.Water bills can be calculated on the size of the property or by a water meter, so get an estimate of the yearly bill from either the landlord or the current occupier.Likewise, gas and electricity depend on the equipment in place at the property; its size and the level of usage by the tenants.Don\u2019t forget that bills will vary throughout the year. You will be paying more for heating over the winter months.Check whether there is a service charge if you are living in a block of flats or there is some other serviced communal area.Remember, the bills are only one aspect to consider, so assess it as a full package - if the rent is low and the bills are a bit high, it may still be a good deal.Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)All rental properties with a new tenancy in England and Wales will be required to have an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). Landlords that don\u2019t have an EPC could be fined \u00a3200 for non-compliance. The EPC grades the property\u2019s current and potential energy efficiency rating as well as its overall environment impact.An EPC:May help you to gauge the potential cost of energy billsCould help you to evaluate whether or not there is a fair rent in relation to the additional household billsCould give you some leverage when negotiating the level of rent or improvements on the property with the landlordCouncil TaxStudents are exempt from Council Tax but you must remember to apply for exemption. You will need to send your council a copy of your Confirmation of Study Letter, available from your student record.If you decide to move in with non-students, they may expect you to pay towards the Council Tax bill - so always check this before agreeing to move in.For more details on being exempt and council tax in general, please refer to our Council tax & household bills section and read our article Who is exempt from paying Council Tax?InsuranceYour Landlord is responsible for insuring the building but to secure your own belongings, you will need to take out a contents insurance policy. You may be covered by your parents\u2019 policy but if not, shop around for personal or group insurance.Endsleigh specialise in student insurance but have a look for other quotes too. Check what your policy covers, if your mobile phone is included you won\u2019t need separate insurance to protect it.TV LicenceIf you stream live TV or use BBC iPlayer, you need a licence. It is everyone\u2019s responsibility! If it is watched in a house where you live then you will be committing a criminal offence by not having a licence. If you are living in halls of residence or have your own licence to rent a room in a shared house you will probably need your own TV licence.If in doubt, check with TV Licensing.Broadband, phone and TV packagesThere are many packages on the market and whilst you may only need broadband (most students use their mobile phones) sometimes a full package can work out cheaper.Watch out for:Introductory offers, a reduced price for the first 3 months and then significantly more expensive for the rest of the contractMinimum contract periodsUse of the house phone to make overseas calls or premium rate calls \u2013 bills will quickly add up! Cable.co.uk is an Ofcom approved comparison site which lets you compare the main operators and see the basic terms and conditions. There are several price comparison sites and suppliers on the market so always take the time to shop around and do your research.If you live in a house share, come to an agreement about who will be responsible for which bills and how to pay them. If you plan to use direct debit to get a discount, a bank account will have to be used. Therefore you will have to discuss who will be responsible for this and how payments will be collected.For hints and tips on how to reduce your household bills visit Money Saving Expert and The Money Charity.Don\u2019t forget \u2013 if you are struggling to manage your money, don\u2019t hesitate to contact the Money & Housing Advice team, who can support you.

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01225 Print How can I open a bank account? It\u2019s a very good idea to have a bank account under your own name when you start studying, especially if you have claimed student funding or even for paying bills in general (e.g. rent, utilities, etc.).\u00a0Opening a bank account\u00a0usually takes time and consideration and we recommend doing a bit of research. Remember \u2013 you are the customer, and banks are keen for your custom, but they are not all the same and it\u2019s worth finding out more about what they are offering and which bank will best suit your needs. Which type of account should I choose? Many students opt for a Student Bank Account from a high street bank although there are a number of internet bank accounts tailored to students. Students are often interested in getting a Student Bank Account because it comes with an overdraft and may have other rewards. A Student Bank Account is a 'current account'.\u00a0Many students choose to have a\u00a0savings account\u00a0as well as their current account, so that they can allocate a monthly budget to their current account which covers all their costs. This helps to reduce the temptation to spend all your funding at once.If you\u2019re not interested in having an overdraft or other financial products, a\u00a0Basic Bank Account\u00a0may be all you need. The Money Advice Service has a really useful\u00a0comparison table\u00a0which can help you to decide which bank to open an account with.\u00a0 Important to know: International students probably won't be able to open accounts packaged as 'student accounts' and should look for basic accounts instead. I\u2019m a Home (UK) student; what\u2019s it like opening a student account? Many high street banks market student bank account packages to home students - they want to draw you in at the beginning of your studies in the hope that you will remain loyal to them when you graduate.\u00a0Some banks offer freebies, discounts, cash back and special terms on their overdrafts. Always shop around for what suits your 'needs' and don\u2019t be drawn in by a flashy gimic. The\u00a0Money Saving Expert\u00a0and Save the Student publish\u00a0an annual review of what the banks have to offer, this might be a good place to start your search. I\u2019m an International/EU student; what\u2019s it like opening a student account in the UK? International and EU students are often offered a 'basic bank account' or an 'international student bank account'; the latter may charge for certain facilities. If you have lived in the UK for some time you may be able to open a standard student bank account. You can check the Money Advice Service to find out more about\u00a0your banking options and what documents you will need in order to open an account.We also advise that you read our article - Opening a UK bank account as an international student which provides more in-depth guidance if you from overseas.Always shop around for what suits your \u2018need\u2019 and don\u2019t be drawn in by a flashy gimic!\u00a0 Bear in mind what you need to use the account for, so for example a competitive rate for international fee transfer may be ultimately more valuable than a vouchers or giveaways.\u00a0 Save the Student have taken some of the hard work out of this for you by publishing their annual review of top International Student Bank Accounts.If you are at all unsure about what you are being offered, please\u00a0feel free to contact Advice & Guidance\u00a0for support. How do I prove my identity to open an account?

This is a read only version of the page. Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01640 Print Can I get a refund from a cancelled or postponed event? Navigating refunds for cancelled or postponed events can be complex. In this article, learn about your rights for getting your money back and how to make a claim. What are my rights for getting my money back from a cancelled event ? If you bought your tickets directly from the event organiser or a primary ticket retailer then you will benefit from consumer protections, as required by the industry\u2019s self regulating body. This means you are entitled to refund of the ticket at face value if the event has been cancelled, but this usually does not include booking fees or delivery costs. If\u00a0you, however, bought your tickets from a secondary ticket seller you may not have the same protection, and you will need to check the site\u2019s terms and conditions to see their refund policies. In either circumstance, you\u2019ll need to contact the company you bought the tickets from and request a refund, if one has not been offered to you already.\u00a0Important to know: If you have paid an entry fee for an event such a marathon,\u00a0you'll need to review the terms and conditions of the event organiser, as you may not be automatically offered a refund. What are my rights for postponed events? If an event you have a ticket for has been postponed, keep a hold of the ticket until a new date has been announced.\u00a0You can then get a refund if you are not able to attend on the rescheduled date (this is likely to be at face-value price, and not include delivery or booking fees). As with cancelled events, if you bought your ticket through a secondary site you will need to check the site\u2019s terms and conditions to find their refund policy. \u00a0If you cannot get a refund, consider re-selling your ticket through reputable websites, such as Ticketmaster\u00a0and\u00a0TicketSwap. Important to know: \u00a0If the event postponed is an event such a race or marathon, you may not be able to get the entry fee refunded; check the organiser\u2019s terms and conditions to see if a refund is available. What are my rights on getting a refund for\u00a0hotel & travel costs? If you no longer need a hotel or transport booking, it\u2019s best to get in contact with the company you booked with, to see if you can be refunded,\u00a0or if your booking can be rescheduled for a later date. However, if your booking has been cancelled by the hotel/transport agency you should be entitled to a refund. Important to know:If you have travel insurance, you may be able to claim back cost for the entire trip, so get in touch with them to check what your policy includes. What if there is a change to an upcoming event? If an event is changed significantly, you may be able to get a refund. For example, if\u00a0you paid for a concert ticket and the headline act pulls out, you should get a refund. However, if you paid for a festival ticket and\u00a0one or two\u00a0acts\u00a0are no longer performing,\u00a0you may not be entitled to a refund because the ticket is for the festival not the performer. You should get in touch with the event organisers, who should be able to assist you further. What can I do if my refund claim is refused? If you submitted a claim to the ticketing company that has been ignored or refused, you'll need to contact the bank or credit card company of the card you used to pay. If you paid by credit card and bought anything between \u00a3100 and \u00a330,000,\u00a0 there are additional protections for when something has gone wrong with a purchase. Your\u00a0credit card company will be jointly liable for any breach of contract (like an event cancellation) under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, and you can claim your money back from it. If you paid by debit card, ask your card provider to reverse the transaction; this process is called \u2018chargeback\u2019. This is not a law or a right so may not be successful, but is a way your bank may be able to help you, especially if your ticket was under \u00a3100.

Don\u2019t underestimate the power of a grocery list to deter you from those unwanted snacks; it can be tempting to grab a quick snack on your way back home every day \u2013 but those pennies add up! Stock up on staples like pasta, canned vegetables and soups, as they have a longer shelf life.\u00a0If you\u2019ve got extra space in your freezer, try and cook in bulk and freeze leftovers whenever possible. Don\u2019t forget to read any packaging to check if your food is suitable for freezing.Take a look at some\u00a0student-friendly recipes\u00a0for some inspiration!For lots of handy tips and a guide to where to shop, read our\u00a0Top tips on shopping as a student Consider sharing costs It\u2019s not for everyone \u2013 but why not try sharing the cooking responsibilities amongst your flatmates? That way you can save money, get less tired of cooking, and learn to cook new dishes! You might also want to think about a communal money \u201cpot\u201d that everyone contributes to, for household items such as toilet roll, cleaning supplies, even some shared foods. This can help you save costs. However, be careful to plan this money carefully with your flat/house mates, so everyone is clear on what the money will be spent on and shared responsibilities. Make the most of student discounts Relish in your student status and take advantage of the various discounts available to you throughout your studies.

Take note of the small things Consider your spending; do you really need that \u00a33 latte every morning? Could you afford to get up a little earlier so you can walk instead of spending \u00a31.50 for the bus every morning? The small things add up; adding up a regular coffee, if we do the math is \u00a33 x 365 = \u00a31095; you will be spending \u00a31095 on just coffee a year! Cheaper alternative: You could bring your own homemade coffee in a tumbler every day and save up to go on a holiday instead.

Once you've found ways of cutting your costs, you might consider working towards a savings goal; putting aside a bit of money weekly or monthly for something you would like to do, maybe a holiday once restrictions allow! Emergency fund: Setting aside some money regularly for an emergency fund could be really useful. Unexpected costs can arise at anytime\u00a0and having it will give you peace of mind. These could include sudden health costs such as needing new glasses, contact lenses or dental treatment. For items such as these, we recommend finding out more\u00a0the NHS Low Income Scheme (LIS) which can help with health costs if you have a low income. Check out Blackbullion\u2019s Savings module for more information.\u200b\u200b Say \"no\" to Payday loans Payday loans might seem like an easy way out of a money issue \u2013 but you are just digging yourself a deeper hole. Interest rates are unbelievably high (it can go up to 2000%). This will just negatively impact your credit score in the future and put you in greater debt.

Consider alternative ways of boosting your finances Once you have figured out your budget, it\u2019s worth considering how you can boost your income. Getting a job is one way, but if you fancy that or it's not an option for you, you could consider these: Selling your old things for cash: Take stock of your belongings, sort through and consider what you could get rid of. Websites like Depop, Ebay and Facebook Marketplace are examples of where you can advertise items you no longer need and get some cash in return. Save the Student have put together a list of platforms you can use to sell Books and Clothes, as well as ideas for other things you can sell. Important to know: Be aware of seller\u2019s fees on these platforms. Online surveys: Websites can offer money or vouchers in return for completing various surveys. Save the Student\u2019s article has top tips and lists some of the best paid online survey sites. Important to know: Be aware that these organisations often require you to complete a certain number of surveys and can be quite tedious in order to get something substantial out of it. Be careful since not all websites of this nature are legitimate. Research studies: The research recruitment team at King\u2019s often sends emails about studies that are looking for volunteers. Some studies offer money or vouchers in return for your time and participations. These are good one-off ways to earn some money. The amount you have to do may vary, from completing a single survey online to attending in-person sessions. Be sure to check the description and contact the research team if you have any questions. For other ways to make money, check out Save the Student\u2019s Make Money.Important to know: If you are studying on a visa, this may affect your right to work and make money. Always check your visa and our guidance on working while studying.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Ask for help if you\u2019re struggling If you are starting to feel like your finances are spiralling out of control, it is never too early to ask for help.

You should be able to open a \u2018basic bank account\u2019 with a number of different banks. A \u2018basic bank account\u2019 provides easy access to banking facilities for adults in the UK. Additionally, some banks offer a bank account tailored specifically for your needs as an international student.Important to know: You will need to provide evidence to be able to open a bank account \u2013 banks usually require several bits of documentation.It may take a few weeks to get your bank account fully set up.Your debit card and pin number will be sent to you in the post, so you will need a confirmed UK address. Make sure you bring sufficient funds to cover initial expenses for your first month in the UK. We don\u2019t advise that you travel with large amounts of cash as it is not safe to do so. Come with some cash for general spending (food and travel) but with a means to access more by travellers checks or a debit card from home. This can be costly so do weigh up your options carefully.In this article we address some common questions from international students looking to open a bank account: Which bank should I choose? We cannot recommend a specific bank, it is down to you to do the research and see which will be the best option for you given your circumstances. All banks will normally offer you a basic current account to begin with and may offer you further services after you have banked with them for some time. UKCISA provide more information and useful links on their website about opening a bank account.We also recommend visiting\u00a0blackbullion.com\u00a0(code: MONEYSMARTER) and start their FREE \"Starting University\" online course and watch their useful video on \"How to open a bank account\".Further to this, we recommend reading Student Bank Accounts with MoneySavingExpert and look at further Free online resources on banking with Blackbullion to help you choose the right bank and account for you Where can I open a bank account? You will usually need to visit the bank branch, there are many banks within walking distance of all King\u2019s campuses. Once your account is all set up, you can use any branch belonging to that bank for banking in-person. However to set up your account, you may find it easier to use a branch local to a King\u2019s campus, as these branches tend to be more familiar with King\u2019s students and King\u2019s documents.A number of high street banks now also process account opening online. Once you have chosen your preferred bank, you\u2019re best to check their website for their process on opening an account. What do I need to open a bank account? What you need to provide varies depending on which bank you choose to open an account with, but generally, most banks will require identification (Passport or visa), Confirmation of Study and proof of address in the UK (e.g. letter from King\u2019s, utility bill, housing contract). How to obtain your Confirmation of Study letter To obtain a Confirmation of Study letter: You must be fully enrolled at King\u2019s to be able to get your Confirmation of Study letter. This means all your details have been checked and all your enrolment tasks have been completed. If you need some guidance on enrolling please read our article I\u2019m a new student, how do I complete enrolment?Your UK and overseas addresses need to be up to date. For guidance on how to do this, see How do I update my address on my student record?Check the spelling of your name. It must be identical to the spelling on your identification. If your name is incorrect in any way on your record, please contact Student Records\u00a0who manage enrolment and your record. Banks are likely to reject your Confirmation of Study letter if the name there does not match your other official documentation (passport, BRP). Struggling to access your Confirmation of Study letter?If you\u2019re having any issues accessing your letter on your student record, please refer to our article I need to prove my student status\u00a0which addresses some of the common causes of not being able to download the letter.Important to know: Always check and make sure your letter has the correct information before presenting it to your bank.If you\u2019ve read the above guidance and you are still struggling to access your letter, you may wish to log a case and Student Services can help you. I have just arrived in the UK and I don\u2019t have a permanent address yet \u2013 can I open a bank account? You will need to find a permanent address before you can open a bank account. When you find accommodation, make sure you update your address in Student Records and apply for a bank account as soon as possible. My programme of study is less than 6 months \u2013 can I open a bank account? Not all banks will consider students who are in the UK for a short period of time. You will need to do some research and see which banks might offer you an account.\u00a0You may wish to look into obtaining a Prepaid cash card instead but be aware of the charges and limitations of these cards when making purchases or withdrawing cash. Can I get printed bank statements? We recommend that you opt in for printed statements, rather than online, as the UKVI will request these if you apply to extend your visa. What is the best way to bring money with me into the UK? Ask your bank in your home country to give you a cheque in sterling (UK pounds \u00a3). The cheque will take a few working days to clear once you have paid it into your new bank account. You can also use Travellers Cheques which can be cashed at the Post Office or high street bank but do check the fees charged. Alternatively, you can transfer money from home once you have opened a bank account. Make sure you bring sufficient funds to cover initial expenses for your first months in the UK. Only travel with the cash you will need for a couple of days, it is not advisable or safe to travel with large amounts of cash. Can I open an account based on Sharia principles? Check bank websites and publicity materials. Some mainstream banks offer accounts and services that meet these principles. Al Rayan Bank is approved by the Sharia Committee. The Money Advice Service has further information you may find helpful. I need some further guidance If you are at all unsure about banking in the UK and you would like to have further guidance, you can always get in touch with the Money Advice team and we will be happy to support you.

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01778 Print Understanding banking and financial terminology Financial terminology can be mind boggling but it is essential that you have an understanding of banking terms so you have an idea of what services your bank offers or what you are agreeing to on financial documents. In this article, you can also find\u00a0further advice and resources. What is a Debit card? This card operates like a credit card except that the amount payable is deducted directly from your bank account. This means that no debt is accrued. Using a debit card means that you can only spend authorised funds held in your bank account. It may be safer than carrying large sums of cash around in your wallet. What is a Credit card? A credit card allows you to buy goods and services based on your promise to pay for these goods and services at a later date. The card issuer (usually a bank or credit union) is providing you with a line of credit up to a set limit. Regular payments must be made but you are not normally required to pay the full balance. If you choose to pay less than the full balance you will be charged interest, thus the goods and services will cost you more than their original face value. When used sensibly credit cards are a useful and safe way to pay for goods and services and the items you purchase on the card are protected under the Consumer Credit Act so you may be able to claim your money back if something goes wrong with your purchase. But if you are not paying the balance in full each month these have the potential to get out of control. What is a Store card? Similar to a credit card, in that it allows you to buy goods and services based on your promise to pay for these goods and services at a later date. The company is providing you with a line of credit up to a set limit. Sometimes you earn points or receive money off for the store (and their partners). Regular payments must be made but you are not normally required to pay the full balance. If you choose to pay less than the full balance you will be charged interest, thus the goods and services will cost you more than their original face value. The interest on store cards are often set at a much higher rate than credit cards and overdrafts, but they often attract a discount in the shop. What is a Credit Check? Enquiry made on the credit history of an applicant, normally by reference to one of the major credit agencies. When you apply for credit, companies will conduct a credit check - so keep your file as clean as possible! If you would like guidance on how to check and understand your credit report, check our further advice & resources. What is a Direct Debit? A Direct Debit is an instruction from you to your bank or building society permitting a company to claim regular payments directly from your account. This service ensures you do not miss payments and consequently, you will avoid late payment fees. However, you may feel you lose some control of your finances in this way and may prefer to pay bills when they arrive. If you opt to set up Direct Debits for multiple goods or services, it\u2019s advisable to set up a way for yourself to keep track of these payments, so you know when to expect payments to be taken.To help you manage your money, we advise reading our tips in Top tips on managing your money during your studies. What is a Standing Order? A regular payment for a fixed amount that you can ask the bank to make from your account to another specified account. This is a good way of paying for regular bills such as rent. You will not forget to make the payment and will therefore avoid late payment charges that may be added for missed payments. Ensure you have sufficient funds in your account to meet these transactions. You may find it best to have these payments debit your account after your salary is paid into the bank to avoid returned items and associated fees. Standing orders can appear very similar to Direct Debits \u2013 to understand the difference read The Money Advice Service - Direct Debits and standing orders. What is an ATM? ATM stands for \u2018Automated Teller Machine\u2019 and it\u2019s a cash machine or often referred to as a \u2018cash point\u2019. It will give you money when you put your debit/credit card in but may charge an administration fee. Look out for this before withdrawing \u2013 machines that charge should say this on the home screen.Try to avoid machines that charge for withdrawals, even if it is located in your corner shop, as the costs do add up. What is a Basic Account? Basic accounts must have the following features: Employers may pay salaries directly into themGovernment benefits may be paid directly into themCheques and cash may be paid into themAccount holders may pay bills by direct debitCash may be withdrawn from cash machinesThe accounts don\u2019t have overdrafts (but increasingly they are offered with small buffer zones of \u00a350- \u00a3100 depending on the bank)All money held in the accounts may be withdrawn These accounts offer a solution for those who may have a poor credit history or no credit history, such as international students on a student visa and EU nationals. Many students open these accounts for the first 6 months and then move on to a standard current account with more facilities such as online and telephone banking. If you\u2019re an international student and would like more guidance on banking in the UK, read our article Opening a UK bank account as an international student. What is an Overdraft Facility? This facility on a bank account allows customers to borrow up to a pre-determined limit. This limit must be agreed in advance and is subject to status. If withdrawal exceeds an authorised overdraft limit, customers face high charges. Shop around for the lowest overdraft interest rate. Most banks offer 0% to Home students for the length of their studies with an additional period after graduation. Important to know: Remember to look beyond these initial incentives to see the overall package being offered, and carefully check the terms for repayment. Find out more about choosing and opening bank accounts in How can I open a bank account? What is a Default? This a failure to meet a financial commitment, such as missing monthly loan repayments; so this is to \u2018default on a payment\u2019. Again, this will be noted on your credit file and may affect future lending decisions. If you think you may not be able to make a payment, call the company involved for options, if an arrangement can be made, then a default could be avoided. What is a \u2018CCJ\u2019? A CCJ stands for \u2018County Court Judgement\u2019 and is a decision reached in the County Court which can be for not paying debts. If you pay off the debt, the CCJ is satisfied and a note is put on your records to say so. This will stay on your credit file for 6 years and will affect decisions on your borrowing applications for at least this period. It is likely you will be declined store credit, mortgage applications and car loans with a CCJ on your file. If you are being threatened with action that may lead to a CCJ, always seek advice. What is a Base Rate? The interest set by the Bank of England on which other banks base their rates. Lenders usually follow it by adjusting their Standard Variable Rate. Consider the effect base rate increases may have on borrowing before signing loan agreements, which is especially important with respect to variable rate mortgages. Can you afford to continue making monthly payments if interest rates rise by 1% or more? What is \u2018APR\u2019? APR stands for \u2018Annual percentage rate\u2019 and is the total cost of borrowing including all costs (interest, legal, valuation, arrangement costs etc.). Be wary of interest not described as APR as this may not represent total charges associated with borrowing, there may be added arrangement or final settlement fees. What are Early Repayment Charges? If a loan is repaid early, you may be charged to cover administration costs. The repayment period varies depending on the terms of your loan/mortgage. This should be stated clearly on your agreement. What is \u2018HP\u2019 or Hire Purchase? HP stands for \u2018Hire Purchase\u2019 which is a type of credit whereby you \u2018hire\u2019 the item you are buying for a fixed period, during which time you pay for the item in monthly instalments, plus interest. Unlike ordinary credit agreements, you do not own the goods until the final payment of the agreement is made. If you do not make regular payments, creditors can ask you to return the goods. If you would like to find out about this type of payment and how it works, the Citizens Advice Bureau offer more detail in Hire purchase and conditional sale. What is a Repayment Mortgage? Also known as a \u2018capital and interest\u2019 mortgage. Your mortgage repayments are used partly to repay the mortgage amount and partly to pay the interest on the amount you borrowed. The most common type of mortgage, where unlike interest-only mortgages, the full house loan amount should be fully repaid at the end of the specified term. You don\u2019t have to arrange a mortgage with your own bank. We advise always shopping around for the best option.

You can shop locally for essential items and in some areas local shops may have better stocks of speciality items. Local markets are also good for picking up bargains or buying food in bulk but on the whole consumers rely on supermarkets to pick up their weekly shop. All of the following will stock seasonal produce and run special offers, they can vary in price and quality. Cheapest with alternative named brands and household promotions: Lidl Aldi Unfortunately, neither of these supermarkets offer delivery services. Iceland stock a large range of frozen food as well as other groceries, and this shop does offer delivery. Medium range with known brands and home delivery services: TescoSainsbury\u2019sAsda MorrisonsAmazon Prime NowCooperative Food Higher price range but some higher quality goods: Waitrose Marks & Spencer offer a range of goods; in addition to full department stores they have separate food stores, but this cannot be ordered online from Marks & Spencer.Ocado is an online-only grocery delivery service, offering Marks & Spencer branded groceries and other known brands. Do any shops offer a student discount on food? Check out any supermarkets that offer student discounts on Totum. Money saving tips for supermarkets Home brands: When buying your groceries, home brands are usually cheaper than famous brands and might even taste the same. So, if you don\u2019t mind the plain packaging, go for the home brand. Price reductions: Many supermarkets reduce their prices in store at certain times during the day, often at the end of the day. If you\u2019re using your local supermarket in person, take note of when you might get reduced items. But of course even if it\u2019s \u201con sale\u201d, it\u2019s only a good buy if you will use it! Store cards: Some supermarkets have store savings cards that allow you to collect points (e.g. Tesco club card or Nectar card for Sainsbury\u2019s) which can be used to gain vouchers or redeem it for something else (like a free meal to Pizza Express) in the future.Coupons: Coupons are also a great way to save. Find out more with the MoneySavingExpert. Most coupons are available online as a code so can be used paperless. Household Essentials Most household essentials can be found in the large supermarkets in the list mentioned above, but often options will vary depending on the size of the store, if you\u2019re shopping in-person.Other shops offering household items, all of which can be ordered online include: IKEAWilkoMatalanNextDebenhamsArgosDunelmHome Essentials Accessibility to shops will vary; for example, you are likely to find an Argos in most town centres or high streets. But increasingly homeware stores are moving to larger out-of-town shopping centres or retail parks; for example, IKEA is usually in a retail park and most accessible by car.Most stores offer \u2018click & collect\u2019 options and delivery and can be ordered online. We recommend checking their delivery options and returns policies before ordering. Medicines, toiletries & beauty products Many of these types of products including basic medicines like painkillers, can be found in every supermarket. Some supermarkets even have a pharmacy counter. Independent pharmacies are also low-cost suppliers of the toiletries, vitamins, first aid necessities and beauty items.For medicines on prescriptions, remember to register with a GP first. Many GP practices have pharmacies attached or very nearby, which can be the most convenient option for obtaining your medicines. If you\u2019re unsure where to use, the reception at your GP practice should be able to advise of the nearest pharmacy.Pharmacies can also offer help and clinical advice to manage minor health concerns and offer \u2018over-the-counter\u2019 medicines \u2013 these are medicines dispensed by pharmacists but which don\u2019t require a prescription from your doctor. For more detail, refer to the NHS guidance on pharmacy help & 'over-the-counter\u2019 medicine.These are chain shops which can be found on most high streets: SuperdrugBoots Both shops offer a wide selection of toiletries, beauty products and many of their stores have a pharmacy counter as well.Collect points and save moneyBoth Boots & Superdrug, and other stores of this type offer store cards to collect points.

There are a wide range of apps available which you can access which can help you save money and manage your spending a little better.Our Money Mentors tried out a range of the latest apps and have put together a run-down of what they\u2019re like. Money tracking Spending Tracker This is a budgeting app that allows you to enter your expenditure and income daily.It also has a budget mode where you can plan what you want to spend and track how much you have left of that budget. There is the option of carrying over the unused budget to the following month.The expenditure portion is broken down into common categories such as holidays, shopping, books, etc, and it allows you to create your own categories.It does require dedication and discipline, as you do have to enter everything manually. However, it is very flexible, as it does not limit you to merely cash or card spending and you are able to change the dates of the transaction, so if you forget to enter expenditure from last week, you are still able to do so.There is a summary view and you can use handy charts to visualise just where your money goes.

With rising cost of living in the UK, you may be concerned about what this will mean for household bills, food and travel costs. We have a range of support on offer for you to access, including help with funding, making the most of campus facilities and wellbeing support.Whether you are new to London or have lived in and around the capital most of your life, getting to grips with your student budget can feel overwhelming.\u00a0The Student Money Mentors have developed a\u00a010 tips checklist\u00a0to help you manage your money and budget for the year ahead.Further in this article, we also have a summary of our guidance in key areas affecting your cost of living: BudgetingShopping & travelCampus facilitiesEarning moneyFundingLiving & rentingMoney concerns & challenges 10 tips checklist A checklist of considerations to think about to help you in managing your money and helping it go further. 1. Banking A bank account is essential to managing your funding and your bills; we recommend having two separate bank accounts, one for your personal income from your job and your savings, and the other preferably a student account, for the money you receive from your student finance provider or your main sponsor/funder. This will prevent you from spending the money that should otherwise be going towards your rent and will assist you in budgeting each month. 2. Travelling Remember to link your Oyster card to your National Railcard so that you can save money on off-peak travel prices. Off-peak times are 09:30 to 16:00 and costs will be lower. 3. Budgeting Keep track of how much you\u2019re spending from the start. It\u2019s easy to overspend when you don\u2019t know how much you\u2019re spending. Set up a system to manage your money yearly. If you have a place dedicated to keep track of your money it is easier to maintain the habit. Try setting a monthly budget; there are apps which can help with this. 4. Socialising Try your best not to burn through your money during Welcome Week. There are many ways to socialise without spending money; try to make friends that have similar interests, so you can spend time together without spending too much.\u200b\u200b\u200b 5. Clubs & societies Sign up to lots of societies and engage with their socials and events \u2013 this will allow you to meet lots of new people outside your course and make new friends. There\u2019s no obligation to stick with the society until the end of the year so try joining quite a few at the beginning and then cutting down. Sign up to any free societies at the beginning of the year and look out for free KCLSU events (often with food) through the year to get involved and meet other students. 6. Shopping Make sure to sign up to any supermarket reward schemes. This will help save money on groceries, as you may start buying a lot of groceries. 7. Plan for emergencies When figuring out your budget remember to include some contingency money each month just in case an unexpected expense pops up.Savings accounts can be essential for this; you can have one \u2018easy access\u2019 for emergencies and another for large expenses you are saving towards, for example a housing deposit. If you have surplus money now, you may not in the future, so get into the habit of saving some in an easy access, or even an ISA to earn more interest tax free.To find out more about banking and terminology used around finances, check out Understanding banking and financial terminology. 8.\u00a0The things you can\u2019t live without Coffee and food on the go can be expensive in London. Try to make your own coffee at home, or buy some from the KCLSU cafeterias; it\u2019s one of the best and cheapest you can find in central London. 9. Student discounts Make sure to check out the student discount schemes that are offered by Student Beans, UNiDAYS and Totum, as they can be very helpful to save money when shopping.We recommend researching and making a list of all the apps that offer good discounts for students before you before term starts. 10. Funding If you are a Home student, remember to claim all the funding you are entitled to, which includes completing the means test for student loans in order to be eligible for the King\u2019s Living Bursary. Just because you qualify for the student loan, this does not mean you have to take out some or all of it, but you could be missing out on free funding if you don\u2019t. Also, if you are a Home student parent or disabled student, we advise checking your eligibility for welfare benefits.

Many students have part-time jobs whilst studying at university. In London there are many part-time job opportunities both on and off campus. This can be a useful source of extra income as well as an opportunity to learn and develop other skills. However, if you have a job as a student, you may still need to pay Income Tax and National Insurance (NI) if you earn over the income thresholds. If you work for an employer during your studies any Income Tax and National Insurance contributions will be calculated and deducted from your wages before you receive your payment. This is known as Pay As You Earn (PAYE). How much Income Tax will I pay? Income Tax is a tax you pay on your income. You don't have to pay tax on all types of income. To find out if, and what you will have to pay in Income Tax, please refer to the official guidance for the UK at\u00a0UK Gov: Income Tax. If you need guidance through this information and how it will affect you,\u00a0Money & Housing Advice\u00a0can support you. What happens if my pay varies throughout the year? It might be difficult to keep track of your income due to income variations. If you have accidentally paid more or did not use your Personal Allowance, you might be able to claim a tax refund by completing this form. Use the\u00a0Inland Revenue Tax Checker\u00a0to work out how much tax you should be paying on your wages. Important to know: There is no difference between working during term-time or holidays in terms of taxation. If you are working only in the holidays and your estimated earning is less than the Personal Allowance, you will need to complete a tax return claim as above. What if I work abroad during term holidays? If you work for a UK employer, you might have to pay UK tax on anything above your Personal Allowance and National Insurance (NI). However, if you work for a foreign employer, you don\u2019t need to pay NI in the UK, but you might have to pay tax contributions in the country you\u2019re working in. What if I am an international\u00a0student working in the UK? There are some double-taxation agreements, which could mean you might not need to pay UK tax on your income if you work while you\u2019re a student. However, if your country does not have this type of agreement, you will have to pay tax as of the above. If you're studying on a visa, please read\u00a0I\u2019m on Student visa, can I work while I\u2019m studying? How can I find out more?

If you are about to graduate, looking for a new job may be challenging for a while, so you need to know what your options are with respect to financial support and where you stand with bills and banking.In this article we address some key questions which may be concerning you: I don\u2019t have a full-time job; can I claim welfare benefits?Are there any conditions around residence for claiming benefits?What is the difference between Universal Credit and Job Seekers Allowance?If I have savings does this affect my eligibility for benefits?What if I am unable to work due to sickness or disability?Can I still receive money and housing advice from King\u2019s if I experience financial issues after I graduate? I don't have a full-time job; can I claim welfare benefits? Most full-time students don\u2019t qualify for welfare benefits but once your course officially ends you may be eligible to apply for help with living and housing costs, if you don\u2019t have sufficient income or savings to live on.You may have some concerns about claiming welfare benefits, but you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about claiming Universal Credit or Job Seekers Allowance.\u00a0 As a graduate, these benefits are in place to help you transition from full-time study to work, even if you are living at home or have job lined up in a few weeks.\u00a0 This is an important safety net, which you should claim just in case anything changes.\u00a0 If you meet the eligibility criteria below you should claim from the day after your official course end date.Important to know: It is essential that you apply on time, as backdating the claim is not always possible and it can take at least 5 weeks to process your application. To claim out of work or low-income benefits, you will need to demonstrate that the UK (or Ireland, Channel Islands or Isle of Man) is your main home and you plan to stay. You must also have the right to reside in the UK, so if you are not a UK national there may be restrictions on what you can claim or further evidence that you must provide. Are there any conditions around residence for claiming benefits? You can\u00a0claim universal credit\u00a0if you're classed as 'habitually resident' in the UK, Ireland, Channel Islands or Isle of Man.\u00a0\u2018Habitual residence\u2019 means you're settled here for the foreseeable future and you would have been living in the UK for a minimum of the last 2 years. Important to know: There are further criteria if you are returning to the UK to settle and have been temporarily overseas. We advise that you please seek advice on your personal situation.If you\u00a0require a visa\u00a0to live, work or study in the UK, the rules are complex\u00a0 You can usually claim Universal Credit if you have been granted Indefinite Leave to remain (ILR), unless your ILR was granted because of a relative sponsoring you \u2013 5 years must have passed or the sponsor has died.If you have limited leave to remain, and you are on a Student Visa (previously known as Tier 4) or as a dependant on a Tier 1 or Tier 2 you are likely to have a \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d condition on your visa.\u00a0 This prohibits you from claiming most welfare benefits. However there are some benefits that are linked to national insurance contribution, and therefore not considered public funds, so if you have worked in the past you may qualify for them: Bereavement benefitsContribution-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA) (or \u2018new style\u2019 JSA)* NHS treatment - but you may have paid a fee for this when you applied to stay in the UK (this is called the \u2018immigration health surcharge\u2019)State-funded schoolsState PensionStatutory maternity pay You can\u00a0check what\u2019s included in public funds\u00a0from the UK government website. What is the difference between Universal Credit and Job Seekers Allowance? If you have worked and paid National Insurance (NI) contributions during the last 2 years it is best to claim contribution-based or the new style Job Seeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA) (if you are in a Universal Credit area). This is because your savings, capital and partner\u2019s income won\u2019t affect your claim.\u00a0 It also doesn\u2019t matter what country you are from because JSA is based on NI contributions and is not a public fund. This is paid for 6 months only but may be the support you need while you seek graduate work. Important to know: You can also claim contribution based JSA up to 3 months before you need it, but the Department for Work & Pensions (DWP) don\u2019t always accept this.If you are not sure if you have paid enough NI contributions you can check this here - Check your National Insurance record.If you have not been working and are eligible to do so you can claim Universal Credit instead. If you are working but only receiving a low income, you may also qualify for help from Universal Credit but your savings will be taken into consideration, and as a public fund non-EEA nationals will not be able to claim it. If I have savings, does this affect my eligibility for benefits? If you are applying for Universal Credit, and you or your partner have \u00a316,000 or more in savings you will not be entitled to help from the benefit.\u00a0 If you have between \u00a36,000 and \u00a316,000 in savings, then a reduction is calculated based on the amount you have.\u00a0 Any savings under \u00a36,000 are ignored.\u00a0 You can find out more from the Money Advice Service. What if I am unable to work due to sickness or disability? You may be entitled to additional payments or you could apply for supplementary benefits.\u00a0 Some of these are \u2018means-tested\u2019 but most are based on how your illness or disability affects you and the amount of support you need.\u00a0Important to know: If you have a \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d condition on your visa then you are not permitted to apply, but we advise that you seek advice on your rights and any other options available to you. Can I still receive money and housing advice from King's if I experience financial issues after I graduate? The Money & Housing Advice team at King\u2019s College London are happy to provide advice and information for up to 4 months after you complete your studies, but we may not be able to act on your behalf.\u00a0 If you do need an advocate, we can signpost you to relevant services.

This is true for housing contracts as well as things such as mobile phones, bills and other subscriptions. Student Advice & Guidance offer contract checking appointments as do the University of London Housing Services. For more information take a look at our article Can I get help with my accommodation contract before I sign it?You can also find useful information about your rights and responsibilities when renting by visiting Shelter: Housing advice - Private renting. Report it If you have any maintenance issues with your property, don\u2019t forget to report these to the landlord/agency in writing as soon as you find them. These could range from a broken light or outlet not working, to issues with heating, hot water or even mould. A landlords\u2019 responsibility for repair only kicks in once they have been notified of the issue by the tenants. If a small problem gets worse and ends up causing damage to the property, the tenant could be liable to pay for repairs due to the original issue not being reported to the landlord. For more information around disrepair in your rented home please visit Shelter: Landlord and tenant responsibilities for repairs. Keep warm Winters in the UK are long, cold and wet, so it is important to think about how to keep yourself and your house warm to avoid getting ill, as well as issues such as damp or frozen pipes. Be prepared and put your heating on a timer so that it is warm before you get up and warm when you get in from lectures, but not wasting energy by being on all day. In the winter months it is important to keep your thermostat on a low heat at all times to ensure that your pipes do not freeze and cause damage to the property. This is especially important if you are away from the property for prolonged periods, such as over the Christmas break. Manage\u00a0bills Splitting the cost is the best way to manage your household bills when living in a flatshare.

Splittable even lets you set a friendly reminder to ensure that everyone in the house has paid up on time!Budgeting can also help you to manage your money stress free. Take a look at our article Top tips on managing your money during your studies and other articles in our Fees, funding & money advice category for advice on how to manage your money. Look after your laundry If you\u2019re living independently for the first time, you may not be familiar with managing washing and laundry, so we\u2019ve put together some tips to help you. Stains Red wine This is a common stain which can cause issues because it\u2019s dark and can be hard to remove. First, make sure other items of clothing are out of harm\u2019s way. Then use kitchen roll and soak up as much excess wine as you can. Next, keep it damp. You\u2019ve probably heard the tip of soaking it in white wine, but this is often not be the quickest option or the most cost effective. Cool water will do. Important to know: Don\u2019t use hot water! Use salt to shake onto the damp fabric. Salt absorbs the wine and helps lift the stain, standard table salt will do.If you have access to a washing machine there and then, it is best to get the stain out as soon as possible. You can apply some pre-stain remover, or make your own with a bit of baking soda and water. Then wash as normal (preferably at 30 degrees or lower). Your stain should now be removed. If that didn\u2019t work, try the last two steps again. If it is still there, you might consider buying some clothes dye and make the whole item of clothing red to hide the stain\u2026 For more tips on how to remove other stains visit\u00a0Stain Removal Tips. Washing whites Everyone knows the story of the white shirt which was washed with the red jumper, and a new pink wardrobe ensued. Be careful. When you are loading the washing machine, put the items in one by one and shake out any trousers which may have clothes trapped in them. Check all your pockets; remove any tissues, pens, earphones and money. If you don\u2019t have many whites but need to do a wash, ask your flatmates if they have any and you can load the washing machine together, so you are saving time and electricity. Washing Symbols These can be hard to interpret if you\u2019re not familiar with them. All clothing labels will have information instructing how they should be cared for \u2013 washing temperatures, cycles and whether or not they can be ironed, tumbled dried or if they should be dry cleaned. It is advisable to always check these labels on new clothes.For guidance on these symbols read What do the washing symbols on wash care labels mean?For more handy tips visit Cleanipedia. Resolve conflicts Living with other people can sometimes be challenging. It is common for disagreements to arise which are related to living issues, whether it\u2019s about keeping communal areas clean or issues with noise. Good communication between flatmates/housemates is always the key to resolving issues such as these. If your housemates are unaware of an issue that is bothering you, try speaking to them about it; together you may be able to resolve the issue before it becomes a huge problem. It is also important to put any agreements between housemates into writing at the start of your tenancy to minimise the potential for disputes to arise later on.

Specific scam: Red Lion House\u00a0Accommodation\u00a0Scam A group of scammers under the company name \u2018Red Lion House Ltd\u2019 have been advertising fake student accommodation on their webpages to International students, and have asked students to pay a large deposit upfront to secure their accommodation for the upcoming academic year.\u00a0Please do not book or pay for accommodation with this company.If you are unsure or worried that you\u2019ve been affected by this scam, please contact the Money & Housing Advice Team or University of London Housing Service to speak to a Housing Adviser who can help you with the process.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Tips on what to look out for to help you avoid accommodation scams Never hand over any money if you have not seen the property Criminals posing as landlords might ask you to transfer money (to them or to yourself) as a means of proving that you can afford a property or to show that you\u2019re not a 'timewaster\u2019.\u00a0This is a scam which is prevalent on internet message-boards. It should be reported to the website administrator or the police.Services such as Western Union or Moneygram should never be used to transfer money to people that you do not know. Does this person have the right to let the property? You can perform a\u00a0Land Registry\u00a0search online if you have the full address of a property. This costs \u00a33.The name of the owner will be under the \u2018Proprietorship Register\u2019 (SECTION B).You can verify the full address of a property using the\u00a0Post Office\u00a0website. Be cautious of contact details If the landlord or agent don\u2019t have a UK-based phone number or only want to converse through email or Whatsapp messages, you should be very careful. This can be a sign they are not legitimate. Use letting agents who are signed up to a professional body or code of practice For example\u00a0Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA)\u00a0and the\u00a0University of London Housing Services Code of Good Practice. Others include\u00a0SafeAgent,\u00a0RICS\u00a0and\u00a0TPO.

UK students are currently being targeted by scam callers asking for money to be paid over the phone. The scammers pretend to be members of King\u2019s staff or from your bank and tell you your account has been compromised. The caller will try to persuade you to move your money into another account.\u00a0We recommend updating your Student Finance password, ensuring that a unique, secure password is used and checking that your bank details in the system are correct.\u00a0Please read this article for the latest information:\u00a0King\u2019s students being targeted in phone payment scam. You may receive a phone call from someone claiming to be from an official body, government agency or an organisation you\u2019re associated with, asking for your details. Even though many scammers increasingly use email and various digital means for scams, such phone calls are still common. This article covers the usual types of fraudulent phone calls, or \u2018vishing\u2019, and how to spot them. Phone call claiming to be from authorities outside the UK A recent scam has emerged which has mainly targeted Chinese students in the UK. The victim receives a call from the fraudster who claims to be from one of a number of official-sounding organisations, such as the Chinese Embassy, Immigration or Customs Services, the Chinese Police, or Royal Mail. They claim that they are investigating international crimes and require the victim to transfer large sums of money to an account in China to be checked. If you think you\u2019ve been targeted by this scam, please report it. Find out how you can get support in our article I think I've been targeted by a scam, what should I do? Phone call claiming to be from the university A recent scam has been uncovered at another university, where students are being contacted by parties impersonating the university. The victim receives a call from the fraudster who claims to be from the university, using small pieces of information like your residence or name to sound convincing. They will advise you\u00a0of your tuition or residence fees being due and encourage you to provide your credit/debit card details. Important to know:\u00a0For tuition and residence fees, King's only accept card payments through our partner Convera.\u00a0King's will never request your card or bank details either by phone or email. Even if the caller seems to know some of your personal information,\u00a0avoid confirming\u00a0whether the information they have is correct. Try not to give them\u00a0any other details\u00a0about yourself. If you think you\u2019ve been targeted by this scam, please report it. Find out how you can get support in our article\u00a0I think I've been targeted by a scam, what should I do? Phone call claiming to be from the UKVI asking for money This is not a genuine phone call.Please don\u2019t give the caller any money\u00a0or any of your bank details. The UKVI/Home Office do not issue financial penalties over the telephone, so\u00a0this communication is almost certainly a fraud or scam.How to respond: Even if the caller seems to know some of your personal information, avoid confirming whether the information they have is correct.Try not to give them any other details about yourself.\u00a0If you feel confident to do so, you can inform the caller that you know they are behaving fraudulently and that you will report it to the police or Home Office, or you can simply end the call. How to check authenticity:You can check the authenticity of any communication you\u2019re concerned about by contacting the\u00a0Money & Housing Advice team. To learn how to do this, read our article What student support services are available at King's? The team will then be able to share information\u00a0with all students via webpages and social media to warn them about any recent scams.UKCISA has information dedicated to\u00a0Fraud and scams\u00a0on their website, which is worth checking for details of current trends in fraud and scams affecting international students. You can also report the matter online to\u00a0Action Fraud. Phone call claiming to be from a government department about a tax or fine What is the call like?You are called by someone claiming to be from a government department or agency working on their behalf.\u00a0 They inform you that you have not paid a fee which you need to pay now to avoid prosecution; examples have been immigration tax (which does not exist), visa tax or a health fee.\u00a0 Quite quickly their language is threatening, warning that if you do not pay a fine over the phone you will be arrested, have your visa cancelled or face further financial penalties. They will try to keep you on the phone and reconfirm their credentials by referencing official bodies such as the Home Office and the Royal Courts of Justice.Reality vs scamThis is a scam. In the rare situation where someone may be fined by the UK Government this will be done so in an official capacity in writing, where you would call in and pay over the phone and to appeal the fine.\u00a0 Even if the scammer claims to be from your home country, it is very unlikely that any official government agency would contact you in this manner and request payment over the phone.How to respond: You should refuse to pay but offer to take their information to look into the matter and call back.\u00a0 If they refuse to give this to you then you know that they are a scammer; you should hang up and block their number. If they do give you information provide this to\u00a0Action Fraud\u00a0when you contact them for advice about the call.\u00a0 No official agency would refuse to provide you with full details of who they are, why you are being contacted and how to check the legitimacy of their claim, as well as how to appeal a decision.If you need help, advice, and support in the university because you have been targeted by a scam or have been the victim of a scam contact Money & Housing Advice Team. Phone call claiming to be from your bank asking for information Be wary of unsolicited calls claiming to be from your bank. Important to know: No bank will ever ask you to share your banking details like your PIN number or password, or indeed call asking you to confirm your address details or date of birth.Scammers often impersonate your bank and can even give you your background information gathered from social media websites or data breaches to make the phone call more convincing. How to respond: Try not answer their questions to confirm details they\u2019re giving you or give them further information.There is no harm in ending a call if you are suspicious that you are being scammed. Visit your bank\u2019s website to find their phone number and call back to ask if you were contacted previously as they will have a record of this. Banking scams are very common, and can happen by phone, text, or email.There are some useful resources where you can learn more about banking scams and what to look out for: Money Helper: How to spot and avoid bank scamsWhich: Five banking scams to watch out for in 2021 Phone call claiming to have kidnapped a family member A recent scam has emerged which has mainly targeted Chinese students in the UK. The victim receives a call from the fraudster who claims to either have a family member in their possession, or that they will kidnap a family member\u00a0if the victim\u00a0doesn't\u00a0do what they say.They might provide personal details that are very convincing which can cause\u00a0distress and may make you feel like you have to act quickly.They might warn you that if you tell anyone about what\u2019s going on, your family member will be at risk and will ask for large amounts of money to ensure their safety.

Unfortunately, students are increasingly being targeted by\u00a0money-related scams. A scenario that is becoming more common\u00a0is where a third party offers to pay a student's fees on their behalf at a discounted rate.\u00a0There are\u00a0no discount schemes at King\u2019s, so if you receive any correspondence\u00a0about discounted fees then it is\u00a0likely to be fraudulent. Please ensure that you only pay your fees through a \u00a0college advertised and recognised method of payment; visit\u00a0How to pay my fees. How do fee scams work? A fraudulent third party might ask you to pay your fees\u00a0to another person or direct you to a bogus site to make\u00a0payment. The scammer\u00a0will then \"arrange a discount for you\" and pay a reduced sum of\u00a0your tuition fees on\u00a0your behalf. The reality is that\u00a0this is a credit card scam, which sees bogus payments being made on student accounts using stolen credit cards details.The scammer\u00a0will make payment as agreed,\u00a0but the payment will be rejected or later taken back when it becomes apparent\u00a0that the card has been cloned or stolen.Sometimes the scammer\u00a0will attempt to make numerous payments of your tuition fees\u00a0with several different cards to try to avoid detection, but this type of activity is monitored by our Credit Control team who might\u00a0investigate your account and ask you to explain the payments.\u00a0The end result is that you will have lost your money, not paid your fees and\u00a0unknowingly become involved in illegal activity. The best way to avoid this situation is to remain vigilant, and if you receive any emails about fee discounts, don't take them seriously and forward on to\u00a0Credit Control\u00a0for further advice. Types of student fee scams Fee payment scams This scam particularly targets international students paying tuition fees. Criminals may present themselves as a government agency and request payment for an \u201cinternational student tariff\u201d, in some cases even threatening to revoke a student\u2019s visa if the payment is not made.In other cases, fraudsters may create a fake email which appears to be from a genuine UK university, requesting payment for fees or informing a student of a change in bank account details to pay fees.To avoid these types of scam, you should: Be wary of anyone who\u00a0offers to make a tuition payment on your behalf.Avoid companies advertising tuition payment services that are not endorsed by King\u2019s.Look for warning signs that an agent is not legitimate, such as requests for large upfront payments, offers to create false documents, refusal to provide references or charging fees for services that the university provides for free, for example, accommodation support.Don\u2019t share personal, banking or financial information with anyone who lacks a verifiable relationship with King's.If you are concerned or unsure, please contact Credit Control for guidance. Money muling The \u2018money mule\u2019 trap involves being offered payment in exchange for receiving money temporarily into your bank account. You will then be asked to withdraw the cash to hand over or transfer it on. This type of scam is on the increase, targeting students who are short of money and may be tempted by offers to make \u2018easy money\u2019 on job search or social media websites.Allowing your bank account to be used in this way is illegal and could result in a criminal record or even a prison sentence. If you are caught up in money muling you are also likely to have problems opening a new bank account or obtaining credit in the future.To avoid falling into the money mule trap: Being wary of unsolicited offers to make \u2018easy money\u2019.Research companies offering such \u2018job\u2019 opportunities and making sure their contact details are genuine.Being especially cautious of \u2018job offers\u2019 from overseas, as it will be harder to check whether they are legitimate. To find out more about this type of fraud, please read our article\u00a0What is considered serious fraud, and how can I avoid it? Student Loans Company (SLC) Scams Be careful of scams related to your student loan. These emails often claim that fees or maintenance loans will be terminated if further information is not provided. They often occur around August/September as that is when many students receive their first instalment for the year and have lots of communication with SLC. You may be able to recognise it\u2019s a scam, as emails may say \u2018dear student\u2019 rather than your name or have bad spelling, grammar and punctuation. Scammers also try to pressure you into giving personal details by creating a sense of urgency, e.g. stating that you must respond within 24 hours or you will not receive your loan.Important to know: Never click on any suspicious links or attachments. If in doubt, log on to your online SFE account separately on a secure browser and look for any notifications. The same principle applies for calls from SFE \u2013 never give personal details over the phone.You may also find this guidance helpful: UK Gov - Scams: how you can avoid them.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Ponzi scheme investments Ponzi schemes are investment scams which pay returns to investors from their own money, or from money paid in by other investors. However, there is no actual investment scheme.How it works: A fraudster places an advertisement for a non-existent investment that offers extraordinary returns in a short space of time.After receiving the promised returns on their investment, the first investors start to spread the word to family and friends. In this way, the scheme gains credibility.Because the money isn\u2019t invested in any kind of investment vehicle, there are no profits. Instead, the first investors are simply paid out from the money paid in by new investors. Victims believe they will gain incredible investments, but the criminals take all the money and invest none. Initially they pay the victims so that the victims recruit their friends and families and then all the money is lost.Please read more about this particular scam at Action Fraud: Ponzi schemes. Who gets targeted? Anyone is a potential victim of a scam. A wide range of scams are very common, can be very clever and may seem legitimate.Students in particular can be vulnerable to scams, and there are particular groups which are targeted more often. International students International students are often targeted due to their unfamiliarity with the UK student fee system.\u00a0 According to the Dedicated Care and Payment Crime Unit (DCPU), Chinese students are also being approached via WeChat (a messaging service). They are approached under the pretence that they could pay discounted tuition fees through a third party. They then get asked to share personal details (e.g. their student ID, portal login details, their date of birth). However, the fraudsters use stolen credit cards to pretend to pay fees and issue a fake \u2018receipt\u2019, to trick you into reimbursing the money to them. However, because the university doesn\u2019t actually receive the money, you will end up being scammed out of your money and still have a tuition fee waiting to be paid. Self-paying students If you pay your own fees, you may be on the lookout for scholarships and other opportunities to reduce costs, especially when transferring funds from overseas.\u00a0 Scammers take advantage of this by creating discounted payment options, which do not exist, and can implicate you in payment fraud. New students New students with new \u2018clean\u2019 bank accounts are targeted by criminal gangs with opportunities to make easy money, by helping to move payments across account accounts.\u00a0 This is\u00a0money laundering\u00a0and can lead to a\u00a0prison term for anyone implicated; in most cases the original criminal is never found.\u00a0Important to know: Always be wary of a new friend or acquaintance asking you to hold on to money for them. Never give our your bank details and periodically review your statements to ensure nothing is occurring in your account. We recommend reading\u00a0What is considered serious fraud, and how can I avoid it? Tips to keep your money safe Be cautious of people/ organisations approaching you via social media and messaging services.Pay tuition fees directly to the university. Do not use third-party services.Report anything suspicious to the university.Never share personal information or student details.

Who can be targeted by a digital scam?Anyone can be targeted; most people have a mobile phone, an email account, social media accounts, and various other online accounts. This means many people across all ages will have been targeted at some point, and digital scams are increasingly common as more and more of our activities and transactions go online. To avoid falling victim to these scams, it\u2019s a good idea to learn how to spot them and stay safe online.However, international students\u00a0may be especially vulnerable to scammers because you are living and studying outside your home country, in new surroundings, in a new culture, and you may not have as much experience of the social norms and etiquette of your new host country.\u00a0Scammers know this and take advantage of international students finding their feet in a new country.Always be suspicious of unsolicited emails and communications which claim to be from official bodies (UK Home Office, the embassy, their bank, or police) that you have not been expecting and ask you to confirm your personal data. Quizzes, games, adverts; scams on social media Many people use social media platforms on a daily basis, which unfortunately means that they are a common source for\u00a0scams and other fraudulent activity. Sometimes activities that seem harmless, such as a quiz or game, can result in you sharing personal information that is valuable to people who want to scam you. For example, scammers can collect data such as your name and birthday,\u00a0which helps them gain access to your accounts\u00a0or take out financial products in your name, essentially stealing your identity.

This exposes you to the threat of fraud and scams. This risk is increased if you use free Wi-Fi, for example in caf\u00e9s or public space, where any security weakness in the Wi-Fi network could be exploited by criminals to intercept data.Keep your devices protectedGenerally, it\u2019s a good idea to make sure your laptop/computer has anti-virus software which helps protect your device from\u00a0malware. Once malware is installed the scammer will often hold your files and block them until you pay them to release them (termed\u00a0\u2018ransomware\u2019). To avoid this, don\u2019t open any suspicious email attachments and change your web browser settings to block any pop-ups that may come from visiting any unsafe sites.

It can be common to encounter people claiming to sell tickets outside venues. While\u00a0there might\u00a0be genuine people selling tickets outside any show or venue, you should avoid purchasing tickets in\u00a0this way.

Money muling or money laundering commonly affects students. It's regarded as serious fraud, and is usually connected to organised crime. Getting involved in this type of activity is a crime and can have serious consequences for you and your future.What is money laundering?It's important for you to be vigilant about your finances so that you don't accidentally become a target of Money Mule scams. These are activities\u00a0where a scammer will ask you to store money illegally in your account in return for a small reward. This is money laundering, and you can be convicted for this offence.\u00a0It is one of the ways criminals use to make their profits more difficult to trace. If you willingly accept the money and then re-transfer it later on, there will be no way to prove that you didn\u2019t know how the money was sourced originally. You also won\u2019t know where the money is going; these groups often use the money to fund criminal activity such as drug dealing, human trafficking or even terrorism. Important to know: Money laundering has the maximum sentence of up to 14 years in prison. It will also greatly affect your future \u2013 your bank account will be closed, and you will be unable to access credit in the future. How can I be approached? You may be approached by criminals online or in person, and even via social media such as Snapchat or Instagram. Sometimes fake job adverts are used to lure people in. They use phrases like \u201cearn money quickly\u201d with \u201cno effort\u201d and \u201cno experience required\u201d. Criminal groups particularly target young people and students as they are less likely to understand the repercussions of any involvement, and the majority don\u2019t have history of criminal activity, which makes these transactions seem less suspicious to banks.There are situations that you might encounter where it's not immediately obvious that you\u2019re being asked to be a money mule. For example, a flatmate could ask you to transfer some of their money into your account while they apply for an income-dependent bursary. This\u00a0might seem like a reasonable favour. However, holding sums of money on a flatmate's behalf so that they can\u00a0secure an award\u00a0they're not eligible to receive could jeopardise both your places at the university. It could also get you into trouble with the law. What can I do if I get approached for this type of activity? If you do get contacted by a fraudster online or by social media or suspect any criminal activity, please report it to Action Fraud.Key things to remember: Always be wary of a new friend or acquaintance asking you to hold on to money for them. If it is too good to be true, it usually is. People often get enticed by phrases like \u201ceasy money for little/no effort\u201d, \u201cmake money quickly from home\u201d or \u201cno experience needed\u201d. These claims should raise your suspicion and you should question the intent and repercussions for getting involved with organisations/people you know very little about. Never give out your bank details and periodically review your statements to ensure nothing unusual is occurring in your account.If you are approached by a fraudster, please report it so other people don\u2019t fall victim to their scams.

Cyber kidnapping is where scammers trick a victim into thinking a family member, friend or loved one has been kidnapped. We are aware that students across the globe are being targeted by this type of scam, including in the USA and here in the UK. Scammers may call you stating that they either have a family member in their possession or will kidnap a family member if you don't do what they say. They might warn you that if you tell anyone about what\u2019s going on, your family member will be at risk and will ask for large amounts of money to ensure their safety. They might provide personal details that are very convincing to cause distress and make you feel like you have to act quickly. There have also been cases where students have been forced to stage their own kidnapping, by providing images or videos of themselves, so that scammers can extort money from their relatives. What to do if you receive a call like this If you get a call like this, hang up straight away and report it. You won\u2019t be in any trouble for reporting the call but communicating with a scammer, or transferring money, does put you at risk. Contact the Money and Housing Advice Service for support and report the scam to\u00a0Action Fraud\u00a0to help prevent this happening to others.

What will happen to my student overdraft when I complete my studies? If you currently have an interest free overdraft, please be aware that it will not remain interest free forever. We advise that you check your terms and conditions for when interest will be applied and make plans to repay this once you are working.\u00a0Most banks offer a transition period from the end of study to starting work, before you have to start paying back your overdraft to avoid paying interest.\u00a0 This will differ from account to account and bank to bank so check directly your bank.If you\u2019re not sure how to start paying it back, Which have a great guide on how to manage this. When will I start to pay back my student loans from the Student Loans Company (SLC)? You would normally start to repay your student loan from the April after you complete your course.\u00a0 How much to you repay and how much interest you accrue, will depend on how much you are earning and which type of student loan you have (Plan 1, Plan 2 or Postgraduate Loan). Most current students or those just graduating this year, will be on a Plan 2 loan. If you started your course before September 2012 or your loan is from Northern Ireland or Scotland then you are on Plan 1. Plan 2 Plan 2 loans will only be paid back once you earn over \u00a325,725 a year, \u00a32,144 a month or \u00a3495 a week. You pay back 9% of the amount over the threshold; for example, if your salary is \u00a326,725 then you pay 9% of the \u00a31000 that you are over the threshold so \u00a390 per year. The payment comes directly out of your payslip, like a tax, if you\u2019re employed. Self-employed graduates will need to tick the box on their tax return to indicate that they have a student loan and graduates working overseas will need to submit an \u2018Overseas Income Assessment Form\u2019.You are gaining interest on your student loan while you are studying, at the rate of the UK Retail Price Index (RPI) plus 3%. Once you graduate, the interest will range from RPI to RPI plus 3% based on your income.You can pay the SLC directly to make extra payments or pay off the loan in full at any time. This may save you money in the long run, by avoiding interest on the loan, but make sure this works with your budget as many essentials come before this when budgeting priorities. Important to know: If you don\u2019t pay off the whole loan within 30 years of starting repayments, the SLC normally writes-off the loan, meaning you no longer pay anything back. Plan 1 This plan is different from Plan 2 loans in several ways. You have a Plan 1 loan if your course started before 1\u00a0September 2012 or anytime if your loan is from Northern Ireland or Scotland. The repayments begin at a lower threshold, \u00a318,935 a year, \u00a31,533 a month or \u00a3354 a week. The repayments are still made as 9% of the amount over the threshold, e.g. a salary of \u00a319,935 pays back 9% of the \u00a31000 over the threshold, \u00a390 per year. You pay the loan back using the same system as above, most people having it automatically taken out of their payslip.Important to know: Another difference is that the interest rate on the loan is set every September. There is variation in getting the loan written off, so check based on your circumstances with the SLC.\u00a0Full details and links for further information are available from UK.GOV. Can I still receive money and housing advice from King's if I experience financial issues after I graduate? The Money & Housing Advice team at King\u2019s College London are happy to provide advice and information for up to 4 months after you complete your studies, but we may not be able to act on your behalf.\u00a0 If you do need an advocate, we can signpost you to relevant services.

This is a read only version of the page. Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-02088 Print I have a question about my fee status What is a fee status? A fee status is assigned to applicants during the admissions process to reflect the different levels of tuition fees for our programmes. There are two fee statuses: Home and Overseas. We follow national regulations and guidelines outlined on UKCISA (UK Council for International Student Affairs) about which applicants are permitted to pay a lower rate of fees (the Home fee). How will King's determine my fee status? Your fee status is determined by several factors, and\u00a0not\u00a0just by your nationality or where you currently live. The information on your application form will help us assess your fee status;\u00a0if we\u2019re unsure we might\u00a0send you an additional fee status questionnaire via King\u2019s Apply to gather further information about your circumstances. Further information about the fee status assessment process is outlined in the fee status assessment policy. If your application to King\u2019s is successful, we will inform you of your fee status within your offer letter which can be found on King\u2019s Apply. Important to know: If you have any questions about your fee status once you've applied, please contact King's Admissions via\u00a0King's Apply. If you have received an offer of study and wish to have your fee status reassessed, please follow the guidance on the relevant webpage under the heading \u2018Fee status reassessment for applicants\u2019: Undergraduate admissions policyPostgraduate admissions policyPostgraduate research admissions policy Post-enrolment, there are limited opportunities to have your fee status reassessed and there are strict criteria surrounding this, therefore, it is important that any concerns you have about your fee status should be raised before accepting your offer and before enrolling. Can King's determine my fee status before I submit an application? Unfortunately, we are unable to assess your fee status before you submit an application to King\u2019s, but we hope that the information available on UKCISA will be a useful guide. Will my fee status remain the same for the duration of my studies? Your fee status is assessed before the start of the course and normally remains the same for the duration of the course. However, in certain circumstances, fee status can change part-way through a course. These include: If you are granted refugee status in the UKIf you or a relevant family member is granted humanitarian protection in the UKIf you obtain settled status in the UK part-way during your course see: I have gained settled status part-way my course, how does this affect my fees?) The full list of categories and guidance surrounding Home fee eligibility can be found on UKCISA. If you have refugee status or humanitarian protection you may find the following articles helpful: What is forced migration and what support is available?How can I get help with fees and funding as a forced migrant student? If you believe you qualify for a change in fee status part-way through your course, you should follow the Fee Status Review process for enrolled students below: I've enrolled and I believe my fee status is incorrect, how can I request a review? I've gained settled status part way through my course, how does this affect my fees? Previously, gaining settled status part-way through a course did not change a student\u2019s eligibility for Home fees as the requirement to be settled had to be met by the start of a course. However, for academic years starting on or after 1 August 2024, the regulations are changing to allow students who acquire settled status part-way through their course to have access to UKCISA categories for home fee eligibility. It is now sufficient to have settled status on the first day of the academic year you are paying fees for (this could be year 2, year 3, or later in your course). Having settled status requires being both ordinarily resident in the UK and having, for example, Indefinite Leave to Remain/Enter, British citizenship or Republic of Ireland citizenship. The full definition of settled can be found on UKCISA. Being settled is not the only criteria that will need to be met and students wishing to have their fee status re-reviewed on this basis will need to meet all the criteria for one of the following UKCISA categories: 3 years in UK and Islands, settled in UK (use this category only if the academic year you are paying fees for starts on or after 1 August 2024)3 years in Republic of Ireland/UK/Islands, settled in UK (use this category only if the academic year you are paying fees for starts on or after 1 August 2024)Residence in British Overseas Territories, course starts on or after 1 August 2022 (use this category only if the academic year you are paying fees for starts on or after 1 August 2024) The full criteria for these categories can be found on\u00a0UKCISA's guide. If you acquire settled status part-way through your course and believe you meet the full criteria for Home fees through one of the UKCISA categories listed above, follow the Fee Status Review process below for enrolled students: I've enrolled and I believe my fee status is incorrect - how can I request a review? What is settled status? There are many different types of immigration statuses so it can be hard to know if you meet the definition of \u2018settled\u2019, which is a criteria for Home fee eligibility in some of UKCISA categories. Below are some definitions to help you navigate the differences: Settled: This means being both ordinarily resident in the UK and without any immigration restriction on the length of your stay in the UK. Indefinite Leave to Remain/Enter: If you have Indefinite Leave to Remain or Indefinite Leave to Enter in the UK, you have no immigration restriction on the length of your stay in the UK. It is also known as \u2018settlement\u2019.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bSettled status as part of the EU Settlement Scheme: If you have been given \u2018settled status\u2019 under the EU Settlement Scheme, then you have Indefinite Leave to Remain/Enter. This means you have no immigration restriction on the length of your stay in the UK.Pre-settled status as part of the EU Settlement Scheme: If you have been given \u2018pre-settled\u2019 status under the EU Settlement Scheme, you do not have Indefinite Leave to Remain/Enter and therefore you do not meet the definition of \u2018settled\u2019.

However, if you wait for your result and miss the booking deadline, we might\u202fnot be able to fit you in to a ceremony.We would advise not to book flights/hotels or commit to non-refundable costs unless you are certain that you will be eligible to attend a graduation ceremony. What about King\u2019s Digital students? If you are a student studying on a King\u2019s Digital programme\u00a0your eligibility to attend a ceremony will be determined by your date of award: If you are/were awarded between 2 May and the 1 November, you will be invited to attend a ceremony in January.If you are/were awarded between 2 November and the 1 May, you will be invited to attend a ceremony in July. Important to know: Only awarded students will be sent invites to a ceremony and you should not attempt to book if you are not awarded. I'm studying on a 4-year master\u2019s programme but decided to graduate with a bachelor\u2019s qualification after my third year If you have taken the decision to exit a 4-year course after your third year of study, you will need to first speak to your department confirm your decision. Important to know: You should speak to your department and confirm your decision as early as possible to ensure you are invited to a graduation ceremony. Whether you are invited to the July or January graduation ceremony, will depend on the date by which your department are made aware of your intention to graduate with a Bachelors. What about Postgraduate Research students? If you're studying on a Postgraduate Research course your eligibility to attend a ceremony will be determined by your date of award: If you're awarded between December and June, you will be invited to attend a ceremony in July.\u00a0If you're awarded between July and November, you will be invited to attend a ceremony in January. Important to know: Only awarded students will be sent an invite to a ceremony and so invitations will only arrive after your award is conferred. Therefore, students whose award conferral dates are 1 June or 1 December will receive their invitation close to the closing date of the booking period. We advise Postgraduate Research students to find out when your award is likely to be conferred and to get in touch with us through our contact form if you believe an invitation has not been sent as scheduled.

Important to know: There will be an administration fee of \u00a310 when you book your place.As space is limited at Southwark Cathedral priority for these places is given to students registered at the university. The Southwark ceremonies are not therefore available to external MD students. What if I owe a debt to the university? Certain types of debt mean that your results will not be seen at the relevant examination board and you will not receive an award. If you have an outstanding debt to the university this could therefore mean that you may not be able to attend the ceremonies.\u00a0If you wish to attend one of the ceremonies, our advice is that you clear any debt you have to the university no later than 10 days before your Examination Board.\u00a0If you don\u2019t clear your debt on time, we unfortunately cannot guarantee that you will be permitted to attend a ceremony, and your place may be cancelled.

If you\u2019re unable to attend the first ceremony you are invited to then\u00a0you are welcome to defer your place through Student Records and come to the following session of ceremonies. Important to know: You are only permitted to defer once after which point, in fairness to future graduates, it will not be possible to include you in a ceremony.If you don\u2019t defer your invitation to book but later decide that you wish to attend the next session of ceremonies, it is your responsibility to make yourself aware of the deadline and to book your place. You will not be sent an invitation to book your place because\u00a0invitations are only sent to students who have previously selected to defer their place or are being invited for the first time. In this situation, please contact us through our bespoke Ceremonies & Events contact form. From October 2023, students whose graduation was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic are no longer eligible to attend a graduation ceremony.

Access can be restored; please refer to details on Key information about graduating and attending your ceremony\u00a0under 'Keeping up to date with ceremony news'. Important to know: We encourage you to ensure you can access Student Records\u00a0as soon as possible before your invite is sent to prevent any delay in booking your place.Unfortunately, our booking closing deadline cannot be extended, so if you encounter issues with accessing Student Records and miss the deadline, we will not be able to accept a late booking request. What happens if the ceremony I have been invited to reaches capacity before I manage to book my ticket? Tickets to our ceremonies will be allocated on a first come, first served basis. If a ceremony reaches capacity, your invitation may be transferred to another ceremony for the same faculty or deferred to the next ceremony period. Important to know: It will not be possible to alter the date of your ceremony for any reason, other than the ceremony you were originally invited to having reached capacity. What can I do if I receive my invitation and my ceremony is not when I expect it to be? If you are unable to attend the date your ceremony has been scheduled for, or believe you have been invited to a ceremony on the incorrect date, please let us know. How will I receive my tickets? Your student ticket will be available for collection on the day of your ceremony, approximately 2 hours before your ceremony starts.

In 2007 King\u2019s was granted degree-awarding powers in its own right. One of the impacts of securing its own degree-awarding powers was the need for King\u2019s to design its own academic dress.We are most grateful to Dame Vivienne Westwood for the major role she played in bringing the academic dress, which is based on a medieval design, up to date. Through her reworking of the traditional robe, Vivienne Westwood hoped to \u201clink the past, the present and the future\u201d. The new King\u2019s academic dress design was approved by the university and does not include a mortarboard.Important to know: Academic dress must be worn by all students/graduates, who should also be in smart clothing underneath the gown (no jeans or trainers are allowed).To see what the King\u2019s graduation gowns look like, take a look at our academic dress. How do I book my graduation gown? Gown hire is provided by Ede & Ravenscroft and you can\u00a0book your gown online\u00a0or by calling 01223 86 1854. You must book your gown by approximately 3 weeks prior to your graduation ceremony.Most students will receive a King's College London award and will therefore need a King's College London gown. However, if you are expecting to receive a University of London award please log a case and let us know, and we will be able to advise you on ordering your gown.Important to know: The only approved gown supplier for King's College London is Ede and Ravenscroft. Please be wary of alternative gown companies that offer cheaper rates (including Churchill Gowns) as they do not have patents to produce King's College London academic dress.

Does my gown hire include a hat? For graduates receiving a King's College London award the gown and hood don\u2019t feature a hat/cap (officially known as a \u2018mortarboard\u2019) as part of their design, and so won\u2019t be included in your gown hire.However, many students like to wear mortarboards in their photographs, and so we have a selection available at the photography booths on graduation days. You can use these free of charge; just let us know at the photography booth you\u2019d like to use one.Alternatively, you can hire a mortarboard hat for a small fee for use during graduation event from Ede & Ravenscroft Private Hire service on 01223 20 5617.Important to know: Since the hats don\u2019t form part of the official academic dress, you will not be allowed to wear it when crossing the stage, and any students hiring hats will be asked to remove them during the ceremony itself. What happens if I've completed the Associateship of\u00a0King's College? If you're graduating with\u00a0a King\u2019s College London award and have completed the Associateship of King's College (AKC), you will wear a black epitoge embroidered with the University's lion 'Reggie'. The epitoge is a short streamer of black fabric that matches the fabric of the university's gowns, and is buttoned to the left shoulder as part of your academic dress. This will be given to you to attach to your gown as you are checked before you cross the stage. The epitoge will be collected by an usher after you have crossed the stage. Important to know: epitoges cannot be ordered through Ede & Ravenscroft. They are provided by the Graduation Office based on information from the Dean's office.

If you are a non-EU resident who has been studying in the UK\u00a0and you leave the UK and EU for 12 months or more, then you can sometimes get VAT refunds on purchases you have made in the UK within the last 3 months.

Leaving university and transitioning into life as a graduate can be challenging for lots of different reasons, deciding what to do next, looking for a new job and moving away from friends can all be difficult. It\u2019s common to feel overwhelmed and under pressure to figure things out quickly after you graduate, Student Minds have some good resources to help with this:Planning your futureHow to practice self-care during your job huntIf you find you\u2019re struggling, it\u2019s important to reach out for support. Your access to mental health services may change after you graduate. Read on to learn how to access information and support once you leave King\u2019s. Can I access King\u2019s Mental Health & Wellbeing services after I leave King's? Your access to King\u2019s Counselling & Mental Health Service will end when you finish your course, which is the official course end date as stated on your student record. However, how this is managed will be determined on a case-by-case basis. It\u2019s a good idea to have a conversation about leaving with the person or people supporting you. They can help you create a plan and investigate other forms of support. For information about our other support services, please read our article What support services do I have access to as a graduate? Where can I go for support with my mental health after I leave? NHS treatment For many people, the first step to accessing support is talking to their GP. The types of support you can access will depend on your needs. They may prescribe medication and/or talking therapy.\u00a0You can learn more about the help available at NHS Mental health services. Important to know: Waiting lists for NHS talking therapies can be long. Currently, the NHS aims to see 75% of patients referred for mental health issues within six weeks, and 95% within 18 weeks. Private treatment Some people opt for private treatment, such as counselling or psychotherapy. The waiting times tend to be shorter than for NHS treatment.\u00a0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b There are many different types of therapy available in the UK. Make sure you research different people to ensure you find someone who\u2019s the right fit for you and your situation. It's not unusual to change therapist if you don't feel they're quite right for you. It\u2019s also a good idea to check whether a prospective therapist is suitably qualified. The British Association for Counselling & Psychotherapy (BACP) and the UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP) are the two main awarding bodies in the UK. Both list registered practitioners on their websites. The website Psychology Today: Find Counselling Near You is a useful tool when searching for therapists by location. Important to know: Private therapy can be expensive, with many therapists charging between \u00a350-\u00a3100 per session or more. Make sure you discuss fees at the start of your therapy. Other sources of support Depending on your situation, you may also be able to get support from a range of other places. These might include: Peers, family and friends\u00a0CharitiesCommunity support services\u00a0Your workplace, through the Employee Assistance programme\u00a0Online resources like CBT techniques provided by NHS Every Mind Matters\u00a0and\u00a0Student Space For more information about your options, visit Mind: Seeking help for a mental health problem. What are my rights if I disclose a mental health condition to my employer? Your rights in the workplace will depend on whether your mental health condition classifies as a disability. The Equality Act 2010 says that you have a disability if you have a physical or mental impairment that has a substantial, adverse and long-term effect on your normal daily activities. If you have a disability, your employer is required to make reasonable adjustments to accommodate your needs. To learn more about your rights in the workplace, check out these webpages: Mind UK: Telling my employer\u00a0Gov.uk: When a mental health condition becomes a disability What should I do if I'm in a crisis or need urgent help? If you feel unable to keep yourself safe and are in immediate danger of harming yourself go to the nearest Accident and Emergency (A&E) department, or call 999 if you can't get to the hospital yourself. If you need urgent mental health support: Contact your GP surgery to request an emergency appointment\u00a0If your GP surgery is not open, call the free NHS medical line on 111 for help accessing the right services, but again be aware they are at capacity at present so only call in crisisYou can call the\u00a0Samaritans\u00a0on\u00a0116 123\u00a0to talk to someone at any time, day or night, 24/7You can text\u00a0Shout\u00a0on 85258You can download\u00a0Stay Alive app,\u00a0an app for those at risk of suicide and those worried about someoneIf you are in London, can contact the\u00a0Listening Place\u00a0for face to face support\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Keywords: mental health, support, graduation, wellbeing, mental health support, Related Articles (2) Banking and finance after graduating What support services do I have access to as a graduate?

You can find a dentist using the NHS website\u2019s dentist finder. You\u2019ll need to complete a form to register similar to the process for your GP.Important to know: Under current rules, anyone can register with a GP practice in England and receive free primary care.Not all NHS treatment is free and you will likely need to pay a nominal charge when visiting a dentist or obtaining prescribed medication.If you are an international student, for the first six months of your time in the UK there might be a charge for use of non-emergency secondary care, such as hospitals and specialists. You can learn more about this on the UKCISA website.There are no NHS exemptions or discounts for students, but there are criteria that exempt certain people from charges.

Realising that you might have a problem with drugs or alcohol is an important first step in the recovery process.King\u2019s College London\u2019s policy on drugsThe central aim of the university\u2019s policy on controlled drugs is to balance respect for the privacy and freedom of individual students, with the imperatives of compliance with the law and maintenance of a safe, productive and legal environment in the best interests of all students.Our Drugs Policy is currently under review but one of its important features is the offer of assistance to students who may need advice or counselling about drugs, or about any issues arising from the use of drugs. We wish to support students who have a drug dependency to seek help, and to be supported in doing so. For more detail and the university\u2019s full policy, please refer to:\u00a0Drugs: A Policy Statement. However, King's must operate in the context of national legislation and would be committing a criminal offence were it to knowingly permit the use, production, or supply of any controlled drugs on its premises (The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971).\u00a0 Therefore, King's cannot allow the possession, use or supply of controlled drugs or psychoactive substances on its premises.Where disciplinary action/actions under misconduct needs to be taken, the focus will be on the person\u2019s behaviour and its actual or potential impact on others.\u00a0 The university recognises that the use of drugs and alcohol exists on a dynamic spectrum from managed and recreational to problematic and potentially causing serious harm to self, others and the wider community and as such any action taken will take this into consideration. Counselling & Mental Health SupportAlthough the Counselling & Mental Health Support Service is not able to offer a treatment programme to students with drugs or alcohol issues, we are here to talk about the problem and to help you connect with specialist drug and alcohol services.Important to know: The Counselling & Mental Health Support Service is private and confidential.

What is spiking? Spiking is when a perpetrator administers a substance to someone without their knowledge. Most commonly, the substance is placed in a victim\u2019s drink without their knowledge, or it can be done as an injection through the skin. Spiking is an assault; a serious crime that carries a 10-year penalty for the offence. Such actions may also be the subject of King's disciplinary processes\u00a0if the perpetrator is a King\u2019s student, including student misconduct investigations, with penalties up to and including expulsion, and for staff - disciplinary processes resulting in termination of their employment. London is an exciting and vibrant city, and we believe everyone should feel safe to enjoy it. Spiking and assault is caused only by the actions of the perpetrator, however we understand that providing you with as much information as possible about the signs and symptoms of spiking to look out for, both in yourself and in others, may help you feel more comfortable about enjoying our city at night. If the incident took place on a King's campus: When in a safe space and if you feel comfortable to do so, please inform the university of the incident by reporting on King's Report & Support website and you will be offered access to support.

By recognising the signs quickly, we can help to look out for each other and get support. What do I do if I think I, or a friend, have had a drink spiked? If you feel unwell, with any of the symptoms described above, and think you may have had your drink spiked, or have been spiked in another way, please: Seek immediate assistance from someone you trust, such as a friend or venue staff.Go to a hospital with a trusted person, or in an emergency, call 999 for an ambulance.If you feel comfortable to do so, report the incident to the Police.After you/your friend have sought immediate support, you can also submit a\u00a0Student of Concern form.

What is King\u2019s doing to help protect students from spiking incidents? King\u2019s is working to help tackle spiking and assault to help ensure everyone feels safe to enjoy student life in London.\u00a0 Steps we\u2019ve already started to take, in partnership with KCLSU: Working with venues and local licensing authorities: The KCLSU President has written formally on behalf of KCLSU to the licensing authorities for Southwark to report venues where this has taken place.\u00a0 Security checks and bag searches: Security checks and bag searches are being carried out at KCLSU venues, including random spot-checks on wallets and CCTV is being closely monitored.Where an individual is found to be possessing items likely to be used for spiking, either via drinks or injections, the police are informed and KCLSU reports the incident to the university.Taking reports seriously: We take reports of spiking and spiking by injection assault, extremely seriously. We encourage you to report incidents of this nature to the police if you can, and to report it to the university through where we fully investigate these reports.Helping students feel safe on nights out: Whilst the responsibility for drink spiking lies solely with the perpetrator, we understand that some students feel more comfortable on a night out by taking certain measures such as using drink covers. To support this, free covers called \"spikies\" are available for students in KCLSU spaces to use. KCLSU venues also operate the \u201cAsk Angela\u201d scheme. Training and support for students and staff: The university has training programmes available to students and staff to help create a safe environment on campus and support victims. Consent training is available to all students via the \u2018Consent Matters\u2019 training programme. Staff and KCLSU Advice have also attended Survivor\u2019s Trust training to help support victims.\u00a0 The expectations of all King\u2019s members: The King\u2019s Community Charter outlines the behaviour expected of all King\u2019s members, including ensuring that our campuses are a welcoming and healthy environment for all. Enhanced oversight: Working to prevent and address harassment and sexual misconduct, with the university\u2019s \u2018Preventing and addressing harassment and sexual misconduct oversight committee\u2019, which includes student voice representation from KCLSU. Improved reporting systems for harassment: A key aim of the \u2018Preventing and addressing harassment and sexual misconduct oversight committee\u2019 is to introduce the Culture Shift \u2018Report & Support\u2019 system, which will provide a single, straightforward point of entry for reports of harassment.

How does King's support student mental health?In January 2018, King's\u00a0began a university-wide project\u00a0bringing together staff and students\u00a0to explore areas of university life where we could drive the biggest improvements in our support for student mental health and wellbeing.Our\u00a0Student Mental Health and\u00a0Wellbeing Report and Strategic Plan was produced as a result of this hard work across the university. Students and staff worked together to explore what King's already does - and where we can do more - to support student mental health and wellbeing. The report sets out how we will continue to promote an environment that supports our students in times of challenge and helps everyone to thrive.How is King's raising staff awareness of mental health?King's\u00a0staff have access to\u00a0three\u00a0Mental Health Awareness courses; certain departments might also offer their own bespoke training (e.g. wardens who work in Residences).\u00a0Each awareness course is designed to give staff a greater understanding of mental health, challenging stigma and a basic knowledge of some common mental health issues.Upon successful completion of\u00a0the half-day, one day or\u00a0two day course, staff will either become a Higher Education Mental Health First Aid\u00a0Champion or a fully trained Mental Health First Aider. A trained Mental Health First Aider can support students by: Providing help on a first aid basisHelping to prevent someone from hurting themselves or othersGuiding\u00a0towards the right supportHelping stop mental health\u00a0difficulties from getting worse\u00a0Helping someone recover faster from mental health difficulties A Higher Education Mental Health First Aid Champion can support students by: Signposting to the right support\u00a0through self-help resources, university counselling or the NHSHelping to identify early signs of poor mental health You can find out more about how we support students' mental health at\u00a0Health & wellbeing. How can I improve my awareness of suicide and improve its prevention?You don\u2019t need to be an expert to show empathy, listen and support those who are going through a tough period in their lives.\u00a0Starting a conversation with someone who is experiencing suicidal thoughts can be helpful and, in some cases, life changing.\u00a0There are a range of resources and training courses that can help you to develop a greater awareness about suicide, and to support you to have conversations about suicide with your loved ones.

What is the Chaplaincy?The Chaplaincy is a resource for all students and staff at King\u2019s, of all faiths and none. This means the Chaplaincy is open to you whichever faith you may hold, and if you hold no particular faith, but consider yourself spiritual but not religious. The Chaplaincy is inclusive; whoever you are, wherever you\u2019re from, whatever you believe, whomever you love - you are welcome.King's College London has a Christian foundation, in the Anglican tradition, and takes seriously the pastoral and spiritual support of all at King\u2019s. The Chaplaincy team is made up of friendly Chaplains, lay and ordained, from different faith traditions (Christian, Muslim and Jewish) across the campuses who are available to meet with any member of staff or student in confidence.Chaplains walk alongside people who are going through dark periods, struggle and grief. They also work closely with all other support and service colleagues across King's to ensure that everyone's wellbeing - physical, mental, emotional as well as spiritual - is looked after and nurtured during what can be an uncertain time.You don't have to be in spiritual crisis to meet with a Chaplain; they are practiced listeners and have a wealth of experience in supporting people through relationship, work and study difficulties, spiritual and vocational issues.\u00a0 If they are unable to help, they often know who can.The Chaplaincy is multi-faith, which means that: It supports students and staff of all faiths and none: everybody is welcome.It seeks to promote mutual understanding and respect between people of different faiths and beliefs, including the desire to share together the riches of each tradition.It emphasises community, hospitality and care while also valuing difference and diversity.It offers an inclusive space for worship, prayer, mediation, relaxation and spiritual exploration across traditions.It promotes justice and acceptance over and above exclusion or discrimination.\u00a0 In particular, the Chaplaincy recognises Islamophobia and Anti-Semitism as irresponsible and unacceptable.It believes that multi-faith engagement can enable greater understanding of our own faith traditions. To find out more about who\u2019s in the team, please visit The Chaplaincy Team. Pastoral support Our Chaplains are available to talk one-to-one with anyone at King\u2019s.\u00a0The Chaplains can provide pastoral support to anyone who needs it. They are available to all staff and students, of all faiths and none. They are interested in tackling the big philosophical questions of life, the minutiae of everyday living, and everything in between.Chaplains work different days and have varied availability, so please check the\u00a0Chaplaincy Team\u00a0if there is a particular person (or a particular faith/tradition) that you would like to connect with. If not, feel free to email the\u00a0Chaplaincy.At present, they are available to\u00a0meet in person, by appointment only, or\u00a0online\u00a0(Microsoft Teams). They are happy to work with the camera turned off if you prefer - just let them know your preferences.To find out more about the pastoral support offered by the Chaplaincy, please visit Pastoral Support. Support for death, dying & bereavement The pain of loss can leave us feeling overwhelmed and uncertain.\u00a0The Chaplaincy is here for you, whether you are saying goodbye to a loved one, mourning their death, or asking questions about your own mortality.\u00a0If you\u2019d like to know more about how the Chaplaincy can support you with these kinds of challenges, please visit Death, Dying & Bereavement. Practising mindfulness The Chaplaincy offers several opportunities for you to practice mindfulness.\u00a0 You don\u2019t need any prior knowledge or experience of mindfulness, and you don\u2019t need to hold any certain beliefs; anyone at King\u2019s is welcome to join in.\u00a0Mindfulness isn\u2019t a \u2018religious practice,\u2019 although many consider it to be spiritual in some way.\u00a0 Whatever your beliefs, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that mindfulness is good for us \u2013 body, mind and soul.\u00a0What is mindfulness?Mindfulness is, quite simply, conscious awareness.

This is a read only version of the page. Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01953 Print When I share information with a student support service, is this kept confidential? King\u2019s College London is committed to providing a safe environment for all students and staff whilst studying and working at King\u2019s College London. We understand that some of our students can have to navigate complex personal circumstances at times, and our Student Support Services and Student of Concern Procedure have been developed in response to this. How does King\u2019s handle confidentiality We will always work to ensure that disclosures you make to our range of student support services are kept confidential, unless explicit permission has been given to share the information.However, King\u2019s has a duty of care to safeguard the welfare of our students and any relevant vulnerable groups. \u00a0We will assess your need and level of risk, and aim to support you in the most appropriate way.Important to know: Depending on your situation, we may need to engage with another service, such as the emergency services, community mental health services or specialist support services within local authorities. To enable us to support you, we have procedures in place to help staff\u00a0safeguard our students. To see this guidance, you can view: Reporting a Safeguarding ConcernSafeguarding Policy Are there any circumstances where information may be shared without my consent? There will be circumstances where information may be shared without your consent. These include: Where there is an emergency or serious risk to safeguard you Where you are under 18 or you a vulnerable adult and still at riskIf there is an ongoing risk of serious harm to you or others Where there has been a breach of confidentiality, the sharing of information will be limited and proportional, disclosing enough information to address the identified risk of harm to you and/or others. Understanding consent-sharing in various circumstances Here are some examples of scenarios where a concern around risk of harm to self or others would result in information being shared with a third party: Scenario A Student A told their Personal Tutor that they had not been able to attend lectures because of difficulties at home. The student\u2019s mother has left the family home and the student is caring for two siblings, aged 9 and 12.\u00a0 Their mother has been gone for several weeks and there is no support from extended family, they are struggling financially and feeling overwhelmed. The student is told by their Personal Tutor that a Student of Concern referral will be raised due to concerns about both the student and siblings.What happens? A Specialist Welfare Adviser contacts the student, and they explore what help could be put in place within the university.\u00a0 The student is provided with food vouchers and an emergency loan.\u00a0 The Adviser explains that a referral to the local authority will have to be made to ensure that the student and siblings wider support and safeguarding needs are assessed.Consent is requested from the student but, under these circumstances, not required. Scenario B Student B is a third year medical student about to go out on placement. They submitted a Mitigating Circumstances Form indicating that they recently took an overdose of medication and declared feeling disappointed that they had failed to take their life. The student is asking for an extension on an assignment. What happens? A SOC referral is raised by the faculty, as a result the KCL Mental Health Team reaches out to the student who completes a risk assessment. The assessment indicates that the student is at high risk of harm to themselves. The student then stops engaging with the Mental Health Team. Due to concerns around the student\u2019s risk of harm to themselves, the Mental Health Team writes to the student\u2019s GP to share concerns around mental health. The Mental Health Team tells the student that they are taking these steps to safeguard their wellbeing, but consent to share is not required under these circumstances. Scenario C Student C is studying an MA in English Literature. They are struggling with an assignment and tell their tutor that the subject matter has been quite triggering. The student discloses that they were sexually abused by a teacher at school, they know that the teacher still works there, and is worried about the risk the teacher may pose to the children at the school. What happens? The tutor signposts the student to support around their own wellbeing and welfare.They then tell the student that a disclosure like this will have to be flagged in a Student of Concern referral, as there are concerns about risk of harm the teacher may present to others. Under these circumstances, if the university is aware of the name of the alleged perpetrator, then they can share this information without consent.\u00a0 However, the student is under no obligation to name the perpetrator and no pressure will be put on them to do so. Scenario D Student D is a second year Nursing student.\u00a0 They disclosed to a Disability Adviser that they have developed an alcohol misuse problem and are drinking up to half a bottle of vodka per day. What happens? The Disability Adviser raises a SOC referral and the student is told this is going to happen.The SOC referral will aim to ensure that the student is supported and that any concerns around participation in placement are addressed with the faculty.The student is encouraged to disclose their circumstances to their department themselves.As they are working with vulnerable groups, the safeguarding concerns flagged by their disclosure will need to be shared with appropriate members of faculty. \u00a0Under these circumstances, this information can be shared without consent.

In this article: Common concerns while on placement\u00a0Faculty support for students on placement\u00a0Mental health support at King\u2019s If your course involves a work placement, you may be encountering practical work stressors such as staffing issues, alongside your academic work. You might also be caring for patients who are suffering or in pain. These stressors, combined with the normal challenges of student life, can have an impact on your wellbeing. Common concerns while on placement My placement is not what I expected; what can I do? If you feel that your placement is not meeting your expectations in some way, it may be that you have not been adequately informed about what to expect, or it could be possible that an aspect of your placement area is not meeting the required standard. Regardless of the concern, please raise this with your Personal Tutor at the earliest opportunity so you can get the support and guidance you need as soon as possible.\u00a0To learn more about the role of your Personal Tutor, and how to contact them, read our article Who is my personal tutor & what do they do? I\u2019m having difficulties with a situation or colleague on placement; what can I do? Relationships in the workplace are an important part of day-to-day life. We hope the people and working atmosphere at your placement will be supportive and positive, but if you\u2019re experiencing difficulties with a colleague then please reach out. We advise you to discuss your concerns with your Personal Tutor in the first instance. If the situation remains unresolved, you should then approach the placements team within your faculty for help. I\u2019m feeling stressed and overwhelmed managing my workload; who can I talk to? Juggling placement work with academic study can be challenging. Levels of support from your placement colleagues may vary. At times you may be treated like a student but, at others, you may feel as if the working expectations on you are enormously high. You might also be caring for patients who may be suffering or in pain. These stressors can all have an impact on your wellbeing. Self-care and accessing support is essential. To see what help is available, go to Mental health support at King's.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b I\u2019m lonely and isolated on my placement; what can I do? We hope that you will have a great experience on placement. However, some students can find it overwhelming to be in a new place, meeting new people and balancing the academic aspects of training with the practical elements. This can be particularly challenging when you\u2019re doing shift work. You may not know your schedule in advance or may be working in a different time zone to your fellow students. This can make it hard to contact support services at King\u2019s during the standard UK working hours of 9.00 \u2013 17.00.

We\u2019re committed to significantly investing in our mental health and wellbeing services. Our Student Mental Health & Wellbeing Strategy has driven many positive changes over the last few years, such as the introduction of Faculty Wellbeing Advisors and King's Counselling Online, a 24/7 video call and telephone service that ensures you're supported outside normal working hours. Help improve mental health & wellbeing services for students across the UK King\u2019s is a leading university in student support. By completing the survey you\u2019ll be contributing to research across the sector to improve the wellbeing of students throughout the UK and beyond. How will my data be used? Your personal information won't be identifiable in reports. We may use the data you provide to monitor and audit the way we support different people. Wellbeing and identity are inextricably linked, and we want to ensure we\u2019re meeting the needs of all our students, regardless of who they are or where they come from. For this reason, you\u2019ll be asked to provide your K number in the survey. This is for demographic analysis purposes only. You will not be identifiable in the data. Important to know: Data which personally identifies you will not be shared with any professional services team or academic staff, including your personal tutor or supervisor. What if I take the survey then change my mind? If you change your mind about taking part, you can email us to get your information removed from the survey. Withdrawing from the survey will not affect you in any way. You can withdraw your data at any time up to the end of Thursday 4 April 2024. If you do change your mind, we won't keep the information you have already given to us. Where can I find support? We hope that participating in the survey will give you an opportunity to reflect on how you're doing. While reflection can be a positive process, it can also bring up powerful emotions which may be difficult to deal with. If you need support, contact your Faculty Wellbeing Advisor, PhD Supervisor or Personal Tutor. You can find out more about the ways we support your wellbeing by visiting our Health & wellbeing category on Student Services Online, with lots of tips and guidance from our support services. We have also included some information about support available to you at the end of the survey. What happens after the survey? Once the survey has closed, the data from the responses will be aggregated, analysed and compiled into a report. The report will be shared with relevant teams across the university and used to improve the support available to you. We\u2019re committed to investing in your wellbeing and are always looking to improve the support we offer. By helping us build a picture of student wellbeing at King\u2019s, you\u2019ll be helping us develop a whole university approach where all aspects of your experience impact positively on your wellbeing.

For UK-based students: Our appointments are 50 minutes. For overseas-based students: Due to various licensing and registration issues, if you are based overseas, we are only permitted to offer 30-minute welfare appointments.\u00a0The law in some countries restricts the right to practise as a counsellor or psychologist, and practitioners have to meet the local professional requirements to be legally compliant.\u00a0This is why 50-minute appointments are available only to students who are based in the UK.\u200b\u200b\u200b Will my appointment be face-to-face or online? The Counselling &\u00a0Mental Health Service currently offers a mix of online and in-person appointments. If you're interested in doing counselling completely online, please check out our article What is King's Counselling Online (KCO)? What can I expect from my initial appointment? The purpose of the first session is to consider the problem you have come with and think, with the counsellor, about a way forward. The counsellor may suggest a second appointment if more time is needed for assessment. You may like to consider joining a longer-term therapy group, and this would be discussed during the assessment meeting if appropriate.\u00a0 Students joining therapy groups are usually offered longer-term support, e.g. for a term or an academic year. Appointment conduct Late arrival If you know that you are going to be late for the beginning of your session, please email your counsellor.If you cannot contact your counsellor, then please contact our administrators by email.\u00a0Your counsellor will wait for your arrival and you will be seen for the remainder of your session. Cancellation &\u00a0Attendance Policy Important to know: Please take a moment to read our cancellation and attendance policy. Missed and cancelled appointments result in longer waiting times for students who would like to see a counsellor. If you do not attend your first confirmed appointment/assessment and you do not respond to an email from your counsellor/Mental Health Advisor (MHA), we will assume that you no longer require counselling. If you cancel an assessment appointment, we may not offer you an alternative appointment unless there is a valid reason such as sudden injury or illness. Please bear in mind that all faculties and workplaces must offer you time off to attend health appointments. If an assessment appointment or first session with a new counsellor/MHA is cancelled twice, a further appointment will not be offered, and you must reapply to the service if you wish to see a counsellor/MHA. If you miss one of your ongoing sessions with a counsellor/MHA and have not notified them in advance, or contacted them after the missed appointment, it will be assumed that you no longer require counselling. If you cancel a session giving at least 48 hours\u2019 notice, you will be offered an alternative appointment. If you cancel an appointment at short notice (less than 48 hours), or miss an appointment but notify your counsellor/MHA after the appointment, this will be counted as a session and taken from the total number of sessions agreed with your counsellor/MHA. Please be assured that your counsellor will remind you of our cancellation and attendance policy when you first meet with them. What kind of follow-up appointments can I expect? The service typically offers 4 - 6 sessions of individual counselling. Longer term support may be possible through a small team of associates and counsellors in training. This option will be discussed at the assessment appointment, if appropriate. For UK-based students:\u00a0Our appointments are 50 minutes.For overseas-based students:\u00a0Due to various licensing and registration issues, if you are based overseas, we are only permitted to offer 30-minute welfare appointments.\u00a0The law in some countries restricts the right to practise as a counsellor or psychologist, and practitioners have to meet the local professional requirements to be legally compliant.\u00a0This is why 50-minute appointments are available only to students who are based in the UK.

In this article: Introduction to counsellingIssues we can help you withHow we can support youAdditional & focused supportRegistering for the service Introduction to counselling Counselling offers a safe, confidential and supportive space to help you explore your problems. It can allow you to share and gain insight into your feelings, thoughts and behaviour. The counsellor is there to help you identify and understand more clearly what is bothering you. The counsellor can help you to gain a different perspective on yourself or your problems and aid you in making choices and changes that feel right for you. You can talk with a counsellor about anything that is worrying you and disrupting your work, study or personal life. You might be experiencing anxiety, bereavement, depression, family issues, sexuality, stress, difficulties in concentrating, and more. Your concern may not fall into these categories but if it is causing you distress or difficulty, you are welcome to come and talk to a counsellor. Often students are not sure why they are coming when they first arrive, they just know that things are not okay for them. This is a free and confidential service.

What if I have a long-term mental health condition? We define a condition as long-term if it is lasting/has lasted a year or more. Students with long term health conditions that impact their studies might benefit from a King\u2019s Inclusion Plan (KIP). The KIP is a document you create in conjunction with a King\u2019s Disability Adviser. KIPs are designed to inform teaching staff that a student has a health condition and how it might affect study. The Disability Adviser will recommend reasonable adjustments to be included in the KIP. Once you are happy with the KIP it is sent to your academic team to implement the adjustments recommended to ensure you have a fair opportunity to participate in the course.You don't have to consider yourself to be disabled to apply for a KIP. Email\u00a0the Disability Support Service\u00a0for more information, or to request an appointment to discuss a KIP and other support available.You can also find out more in our article Support for students with long-term mental health conditions.

The aim is to create an online, safe, non-judgemental and confidential space. We hope to encourage a setting whereby students can feel able to share openly what can often be uncomfortable experiences related to identity, race and culture.

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01902 Print Tips & techniques for managing worry & insomnia Worrying The worry tree Trigger: Notice worry - \u2018what if?\u2019; Can I do anything about it? YES Can I do anything right now? YES Fix it! Think about: What\u2019s the problem? What needs to changes? What do I need to do to make it happen? Action! Can I do anything about it? NO Let the worry go!\u00a0 Save it for later, do something else. Can I do anything about it? YES Can I do anything about it right now? NO Can I do anything later? YES Plan a time to fix it! Now do something else. Worry time This is your time to worry about the things that have bothered you in the day. If you start to worry in the morning, stop and tell yourself to save it up for your \u2018worry time\u2019 later that night. Put aside 15 minutes each evening: At the start of your worry time, think of what you have to worry about and then try to do so. Chances are you may not recall what it was, or you may feel it\u2019s not worth the worry. And even if you do, you might find it hard to bring on worry. Thought-action fusing This technique focuses on reacting to a thought as if it is the truth or as if it has actually happened. Example: Sue has the (automatic) thought: \u201cI\u2019m going to do badly in my assignment\u201d She finds herself becoming despondent and losing interest in the notes she was reading She imagines herself telling others that she has failed or got a really low mark She feels very low (mood) and stops studying (behaviour) What actually happened is that she had a thought about failure, but her mood and behavior were as if she had actually failed. Let\u2019s try \u2018de-fusing\u2019 or \u2018defusion\u2019 Try this technique: Take the thought \u2018I\u2019m going to fail\u2019 Spend the next 20 seconds really believing it; say it to yourself like it\u2019s going to happen Now, replace the thought for the next 20 seconds with: \u2018I\u2019ve just had a thought that I\u2019m going to fail\u2019 And now, replace that thought (for the next 20 seconds) with: \u2018I\u2019ve noticed that I\u2019ve had a thought that I\u2019m going to fail\u2019 Rumination What is rumination? Have you ever been told you think too much? Rumination means brooding or thinking in a circular and unhelpful way. This kind of thinking can lie at the heart of some anxiety conditions, such as generalized anxiety. It\u2019s unpleasant, unproductive and can lead to low mood and/or anxiety. Am I ruminating? Ask yourself: Have I made progress towards solving a problem? Do I understand something about a problem (or my feelings about it) that I haven\u2019t understood before? Do I feel less self-critical or less depressed than before I started thinking about it? If you didn\u2019t answer \u2018yes\u2019 to at least one question, you are ruminating! Four strategies to stop or prevent rumination Remind yourself of the consequences of rumination. For example: \u2018I feel more depressed and/or anxious than before I started thinking\u2019. Problem-solve; come up with possible solutions, pro\u2019s and con\u2019s, time frame the problem, and evaluate whether outcome is worthwhile. Mindfulness; attend closely to sights, sounds, smells around you as they happen in the moment. Be mindful of thoughts, allow them to come and go, gently encourage an empty mind, be curious of thoughts, try not to respond to them Focus on the individual steps of the problem; what would I do first if I had to write an essay? If all else fails: try to distract yourself. We know this borders on avoidance behavior, so use this for rumination only. Sleep How can I sleep better? There\u2019s no ideal length of sleep needed; your body will take what it needs in sleep. There\u2019s no sleep deficit, and usually, our body adapts. According to research, people with insomnia tend to: Overestimate the length of time it takes them to get to sleep Be overly sensitive to bodily symptoms, interpreting them as tiredness Underestimate the amount of time spent asleep Quick tips to improve your sleep: Keep a diary of what you do, what you are thinking and what you are feeling before, during and after your disturbed night\u2019s sleep. Is there a pattern of thoughts or feelings? Challenge negative thoughts and create new balanced thoughts. Develop regular sleep times: go to bed and get up in the morning at the same time regardless of how tired you are. Check for any medical explanations with a GP. Use your bed only for sleep and sex: avoiding it for other tasks. Do not drink too much liquid before bed: sleep can be disturbed by urinary urgency. Three-step approach to treat insomnia Pre-step: Attend to your sleep hygiene: Reduce screen time and create a buffer Check caffeine intake Check temperature (body needs to heat up and then cool down) Create a pre-sleep \u2018ritual\u2019, such as; read a book, set an alarm, trip to bathroom, etc. Step 1: Calculate sleep efficiency Sleep efficiency is the percentage of time spent in bed actually asleep (as opposed to ruminating) You should aim for 80% Formula: Actual sleep time / total time spent in bed x 100 For example: Tabitha sleeps for 5 hours (actual sleep) but goes to bed at 23:00 and her alarm goes off at 08:00 (total bed time is 9 hours): 5 / 9 = 0.55 0.55 x 100 = 55% Sleep efficiency = 55% (well below 80% target) Step 2: Sleep restriction Narrow the sleep window by matching time in bed to time asleep, plus 30 minutes. For example: Tabitha \u2013 Currently spending 9 hours in bed but asleep for just 5 (sleep efficiency: 55%), Needs to be out of bed by 07:00 to start studying at 09:00 Bedtime is now 5.5 hours backwards from 07:00: 01:30 Her time in bed will be just 5.5 hours No daytime naps After each week, time in bed is increased by half an hour - but only if efficiency is 90% Step 3: Re-learn sleep associations Aim: associate bed with sleep/sex only If not asleep after 15 minutes, get up and go to another room Engage in a passive activity (reading, writing to-do lists, crafts, etc) Return to bed when sleepy Repeat as necessary The NHS\u2019s Every Mind Matters has information and guidance all about sleep and how to improve your sleep quality, how fall asleep or stay asleep if you\u2019re struggling. Check out NHS: How to fall asleep faster and sleep better. You might also want to try out the NHS Mind Plan.

What are anxious feelings and when should I consider taking action for them? We all have mental health, just as we all have physical health. Your mental health can change throughout your time at university and is often impacted by situations relating to family, relationships, work and the external environment. We all experience anxious feelings from time to time. They may get especially intense when we are facing stressful life events such as an upcoming exam, job interview or difficulties in our relationships. Anxious feelings can be really unpleasant; we may become tense and fearful and may get uncomfortable bodily sensations like a dry throat, sweaty palms and a racing heart. We also may experience daunting thoughts and mental images about worst-case scenario situations and how we will be unable to cope. Occasional anxious feelings are normal and although unpleasant, aren\u2019t harmful. In fact, a moderate amount of anxiety can help motivate us. However, if you find yourself experiencing anxious feelings most or all of the time, then you should consider taking some steps to reduce them so you can lead a more fulfilling life.We\u2019ve developed this guidance using NHS resources on anxiety. It provides some simple tips and a range of external resources that will help you to start taking control of your anxiety today.For more, please visit NHS Mental Health for lots of information, guidance and support resources. Mental health continuum We all have mental health and wellbeing, which are connected and can change often. This continuum demonstrates how all of us, no matter our background or difficulties, can have optimal wellbeing with good self-help and support in place.There is a \u2018continuum\u2019 along which we can have better or worse wellbeing, whether or not we are already facing mental health difficulties.We can all be at a different point on the continuum, at different times: Optimal mental wellbeing with mental health difficulties A person experiencing significant mental health difficulties\u00a0can manage these well and have good support in place, allowing optimal mental wellbeing.Optimal mental wellbeing with minimal mental health difficultiesPeople who are not experiencing mental health difficulties still benefit from looking after their mental wellbeing.Minimal mental wellbeing with minimal mental health difficultiesThe challenges of university life can lead us to have minimal mental wellbeing, in the absence of mental health difficulties.Minimal mental wellbeing with mental health difficultiesChallenging mental health difficulties and a lack of support can lead to minimal mental wellbeing.

Challenging our behaviours Stay connected Even if you don\u2019t feel like confiding in others, simply spending time with people can boost our mood. There are a number of services and communities available at King\u2019s. The Chaplaincy The Chaplains are available at each of the campuses to see any student or member of staff in confidence.

Student groups & societies Joining on of the KCLSU Student Groups\u00a0is an effective way to meet people. There's a huge range of societies, sports and other activity groups designed to cater to all kinds of interests and passions. Developing a social support network and creating connection with others through a shared interest can be a great way to improve your mood. Practice self-care Self-care activities are things that we enjoy that enhance mental, emotional and physical health. They can be as simple as going for a walk, calling a friend, doing something creative, eating a healthy meal or taking a soothing bath. Whatever the activity is, doing something kind for yourself can be very beneficial in reducing anxious feelings, so it\u2019s important to find time for. Check out some self-care tips from Student Minds. Set achievable goals Whether it\u2019s finding time for self-care activities or starting a piece of coursework, we can make things easier by breaking our goals down into small actionable steps and setting just one to three simple tasks to complete for the day. This sense of accomplishment can help lift our mood and create momentum to carry out more tasks. Check out LinkedIn Learning for videos on goal setting. Maintain a healthy lifestyle Diet Eating regularly and keeping your blood sugar stable can make a difference to your mood and energy levels. Also, drinking water and eating vegetables can improve how we feel. Although drugs and alcohol may provide a short-lived distraction from your anxieties, they are likely to exacerbate your feelings in the long run. Routine Create a set bedtime and wake up time that you try to abide by every day. Sleep can have a significant impact on your anxiety. Create a morning routine you look forward to that helps you start the day on a positive note, which often sets the tone for the rest of the day. Try making one small change at a time to help you feel more confident in adapting a healthier lifestyle. Every step is important!

Challenging our thought patterns Identify Identifying thoughts which are contributing to your feelings of anxiety by writing them down. If you need some prompts to get you started: What am I thinking right now? What am I worried will happen? What is making me feel anxious? What bad thing do I expect to happen? Detachment Create some detachment from each thought by acknowledging that they are just subjective \u2018thoughts\u2019 rather than objective facts. You can achieve this by putting the phrase \u201cI am simply having the thought that\u2026\u201d in front of your thought. As an example, instead of \u201c I am going to fail my exam\u201d replace this with \u201cI am simply having the thought that I am going to fail my exam\u201d Although our thoughts often feel like the absolute truth, they are just our brain\u2019s internal commentary about our world, which is often highly inaccurate. Realising our thoughts are just thoughts can weaken the power they have over us. Find a balance Challenge unhelpful thoughts by thinking of a more balanced alternative. You can write these alternatives down somewhere accessible to you, such as your phone, to refer back to when you are feeling anxious. Some questions you can ask to help you come up with more helpful alternatives: What is the evidence that this thought is true? What is the evidence that this thought is not true? Have I confused a thought with a fact? What would I tell a friend if he/she had the same thought? Can I be 100% sure that ___________ will happen? How many times has ___________ happened before? Is ___________ so important that my future depends on it? Will this matter 6 months from now? What is the worst that could happen? If it did happen, what can I do to cope with it? Is my judgment based on the way I feel, instead of facts? Am I worrying about something that cannot be changed? What is the worst that could happen? If it did happen, would it be a big deal on the grand scale of things? Develop a journaling practice Gratitude journaling is simple method to increase your day-to-day feelings of wellbeing. It involves writing at least one thing daily that you feel grateful for in your life. If you cannot think of anything, you can start with the very simple things that not everyone may have such as: \u201cI am grateful that I woke up in a warm bed this morning... that I have an abundance of food in the cupboard... that I woke up this morning in good physical health.\u201d You may find that you are able to identify a lot of positives in your life that you hadn\u2019t previously thought of.Keep a mood journal. Note how your mood improves or worsens throughout the day and what you were doing at the time. This can help you identify behavioural patterns and triggers that make you feel better or worse.

Choose one exercise from the tools and strategies in this article that you will do this week and decide when and where you are going to do so. Complete the following sentence to set your intention: \u201cThe exercise I am going to try from this guide is: I will do so on [insert day] at [insert time] in [insert place] I will tell this person for added accountability and support [insert person]\u201d What are the signs that I may need further help for my anxious feelings? Your anxious feelings are present all or most of the time, even when you cannot identify an immediate reason for you to feel anxious. Your anxious feelings persist for extended periods of time, even when the situation that initiated them has already passed. You experience secondary symptoms that are impairing your quality of life such as: fatigue, weakness, sleeping problems, inability to concentrate, headaches and nausea. You start avoiding important activities you would regularly engage in because they make you anxious; for example going to class, socialising with friends, getting on public transport or being in any other busy spaces. You experience panic attacks, which can be extremely frightening. You may feel an intense dread that onsets suddenly followed by symptoms like sweating, palpitations (being able to feel your heartbeat), trembling and difficulty breathing. Panic attacks usually last no more than 5-20 minutes. Although it may feel like something is seriously wrong, they aren\u2019t dangerous and shouldn\u2019t harm you. How can I get help if my anxious feelings are impacting my studies? Personal tutor: If your mental health is impacting your studies, you should speak to your personal tutor.

Stress & anxiety Severe or chronic anxiety can stop us doing many things in our day-to-day life. We may be unable to walk down the street, go to the supermarket, into a lecture theatre or a pub without feeling anxious, uncomfortable and upset. Over time we may avoid going to these places to avoid feeling so bad. Anxiety Anxiety impacts upon our minds and bodies. Some typical anxiety responses include: Unpleasant body sensations (heart pounding, sweating, tense muscles, dry throat, shaking, feeling or being sick, dizziness).Inability to concentrate.Worrying thoughts or unpleasant memories coming into your mind.Intense dislike or fear of some situations, and therefore avoidance of them (eg talking to people you don\u2019t know, walking in the street, being in a tutorial class).Panic attacks coming out of the blue, and once one has happened - fearing that another will strike at any time.Disturbed sleep, with unpleasant dreams or nightmares.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b If you're experiencing anxious thoughts, check out\u00a0What can I do to help manage anxious feelings? Panic A panic attack is a severe experience of anxiety. People may feel intense dread, experience various physical symptoms, and have extreme thoughts of losing control, going mad, having a heart attack or dying.It is also possible to become afraid of panic attacks themselves because the experience can be so unpleasant. Paradoxically this tends to make a person even more prone to having an attack! Although panic attacks can be very frightening, they are not actually harmful - people do not actually have heart attacks, develop psychiatric illnesses, or die from them. Where can I get help? The NHS has information and guidance Anxiety and panic attacks.Register with the Counselling & Mental Health Service for an appointment. You can be seen on an individual basis on or in a group specifically designed to address anxiety management.Speak to a close friend or family member, Personal Tutor or Supervisor.Talk to your GP. Relationship difficulties Problems with relationships arise for most people at some time in their lives and this is one of the most common areas of life that people seek counselling for. It may help to make an appointment with the service, where you can talk to someone who is completely separate from all other aspects of your life.Relate is the country's largest provider of relationship support, working to promote health, respect and justice in couple and family relationships. Self-harm \u2018Self-harm\u2019 is used to describe a wide range of behaviours - but here we are referring mainly to cutting: i.e. using a sharp instrument such as a razor blade to inflict cuts, usually on arms, legs or torso.Self-harm is often understood to be a physical response to an emotional pain of some kind. It leads to chemical changes in the brain which are very addictive.Self-harm is a very common problem. It is thought that around 13% of young people may try to hurt themselves on purpose (intentionally self-harm) at some point between the ages of 11 and 16, but the actual figure could be much higher. It is often difficult to talk about self-harm; we may feel ashamed of our behaviour and it may be difficult to put into words what we are feeling and thinking when we do self-harm. You may need to seek medical assistance to deal with any injuries. Depending on the severity, you should contact A&E or your GP.If you want to stop, counselling can help you explore ways that will suit you. For some people, counselling can be invaluable. By exploring and understanding problems that feel overwhelming, you can learn to cope with and handle feelings in a different, less destructive way. Help & support You can make an appointment with the Counselling Service when you register.The National Self-Harm Network is a volunteer organisation whose objective is to support those who self-harm. They have lots of useful resources to download and links to local support networks.Self-harm UK offers support for 14 \u2013 19 year-olds. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Drugs or alcohol Realising that you might have a problem with drugs or alcohol is an important first step in the recovery process.For more information and guidance please read our article How can I get support for difficulties with drugs or alcohol? Eating disorders To help understand eating disorders better and where to get help, please read our article What are eating disorders, and how can I get help? Understanding and expressing gender and sexuality Gender Sometimes going to university can provide us with a chance to be ourselves and express ourselves in a way we have not been able to before.We may be aware that the gender we were born into is not an accurate reflection of the gender we feel ourselves to be. We may not identify as \u2018male\u2019 or \u2018female\u2019 and feel that our gender expression is fluid or neutral. Sometimes it can feel painful and lonely to feel different and we may wish we were just like everyone else. Sometimes the problem is not about how we feel, but about how those who know us and care about us respond to our difference. Talking to a counsellor can be very helpful and provides an opportunity to process our feelings in a non-judgmental environment. Support & information Counselling & Mental Health Service: Register and arrange an appointment with the service; a counsellor can help you to talk about and process your feelings.Gendered intelligence: Creative workshops, arts programmes, conferences and youth group sessions.NHS: Has information, guidance and resources for young people to support with questions or concerns around gender identity. Sexuality Sexuality can describe the whole way a person goes about expressing themselves as a sexual being. Acceptance of our own sexuality: Sometimes we are aware that we have always had a particular sexual preference from an early age.Sometimes this is not the case and it may be that \u2018coming out to yourself\u2019 is an anxious process and characterised by a period of upheaval and uncertainty If you want someone to talk to during this time, the Counselling Service will be happy to help you. Coming out to others Our families can have detailed plans and dreams for us and can be very upset when it becomes clear that not all their hopes are going to be realised. Similarly, friends and other groups may have their own very definite opinions or prejudices. It is important that you come out to people who will validate and celebrate your new-found sexuality, as well as to people who may question it. You may also want to talk over the situation in detail first.Where can I get support? The Counselling Service will be glad to offer support and counselling on any of the matters discussed above, as will the Student's Union. To get support from the service please register. LGBT: Sexuality & gender identity LGBT students may have issues to deal with around anxiety about \u2018coming out\u2019, or questions and perhaps feelings of confusion around sexuality, or reconciling sexuality and or gender with identity. You may be clear about your sexuality and identity - may easily think of yourself and identify with being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or other gender/sexual minorities, but you may not find this such an easy and clear issue.You may be confused around identifying as LGBT, but still find yourself attracted to same sex, or to no one at all, and/or find your gender expression different to that expected of genetic sex (or not be sexually male or female at all).Any one of these issues can be difficult to come to terms with on your own and can be extremely difficult to come to terms with, understand and then discuss with friends and family. This is when it may be helpful to approach the Counselling Service to begin to talk through some of the difficulties in expression. Coming to counselling may be the helpful first step to accessing longer-term support and therapy. Sexuality Sexuality refers to the way in which we express ourselves as a sexual beings, how that sexuality is expressed. Sexuality is a rich and complex area of personal experience, which seems to be formed by the time we reach adolescence and teenage years - although it can take many years before we each understand and accept our sexuality. Gender identity Gender identity is an individual\u2019s sense of \u2018being\u2019 \u2018male\u2019, \u2018female\u2019 \u2018intersex\u2019 or \u2018transgender\u2019. It is also a social construction that categorises certain behaviours into binary male and female roles.For transgender people, gender identity may differ from physical anatomy or expected social roles. It is important to bear in mind that gender identity, biological sex, and sexual orientation are not necessarily linked.Gender identity conflicts can stem from an individual\u2019s gender identity not matching their biological sex, an individual\u2019s gender identity being neither completely male nor female, or an individual\u2019s biological sex not being uniquely male or female.Many say that they find acknowledging and exploring their difference a positive life changing experience - that as difficult as it may be, being different can also be freeing - in the sense that it enables a choice around gender expression or relationship style which suits the individual, \u00a0rather than being prescribed by society.Counselling support may be helpful, but equally the LGBT+ community may be able to offer an opportunity to meet and mix with a wide variety of individuals. The experience of coming to know oneself and being out can be both challenging and inspiring. The Counselling & Mental Health Support Service will be glad to offer support on any of the matters discussed above, as will the Student's Union LGBT Association.

Sexual difficulties What are sexual difficulties? Sometimes we realise that our experience of sex is different to others \u2013 whether it is unexpectedly painful, or we have no desire or feeling; either way it may feel that we are missing out or \u2018not doing it right\u2019. There is a lot of information available about sex - these websites below are a good place to start.

Parental separation & divorce Approximately one in three marriages end in divorce and it is relatively common for parents to wait until their children leave home before separating. It is highly likely that you will experience intense feelings (though there isn't anything wrong with you if you don't). These may include: ShockPowerlessnessInsecurityConfusionAngerSadnessAnxietyGuilt Many of these feelings are expressions of grief for your loss, and these losses, both practical and emotional, may initially cause you most concern: Loss of \"home\", physically and emotionallyLoss of security and the protection a united family can provideLoss of financial stability as your parents become separate entitiesLoss of trust of past and futureLoss of parental interest as they struggle with their own lives and feelingsLoss of continuity and the uncertainty which goes with itLoss of whatever your family has meant to you up until now. Help & support If you are struggling with the impact of your parents\u2019 divorce, it may help to make an appointment with the Counselling & Mental Health Support Service, where you can talk to someone who is completely separate from all other aspects of your life. Here you can express your feelings freely and take time to begin to come to terms with some of the changes you are facing.Relate can also offer a counselling service for young people (under 25) who are affected by their parents\u2019 separation. Anger Do you feel that your anger goes beyond what is normal or healthy? Have you ever been told that you have \u2018anger issues\u2019? Most people have been angry at times in their lives, but sometimes it can feel excessive or uncontrollable and might even be impacting negatively on our relationships. Counselling might help you learn to manage your anger and understand the triggers. If you think that you may have a problem with anger, there is support and advice available: The Counselling service can help you to develop new ways of coping with and expressing angry feelings. You might want to speak to your GP. Bereavement The death of someone who is significant to us is perhaps one of the hardest things we will experience in life. Whether it is expected or a shock, the enormity of loss is something that impacts on us profoundly. Usually, this is experienced with not just one feeling but a whole range of feelings. This is a normal natural process. Coping with loss is difficult at any time, but as a student, perhaps isolated from family and friends, with other pressures such as deadlines to meet, exams to revise for and potential money worries, it can feel worse. Dealing with grief Grief may take a long time to work through. It is an inevitable and human response.These are some of the feelings and behaviours that are often experienced, sometimes in quick succession: Shock and disbelief: you may feel numb and be unable to take in what has happened.Anxiety and panic: sometimes in situations that wouldn\u2019t normally bother you.Guilt and regret: whether for things you wish you had said and done (or not done), or for just being alive; these feelings are particularly strong when someone has completed suicide.An overwhelming sense of loss and sadness: sometimes we may feel as though a part of ourselves has been lost.Depressed: feelings of wanting to withdraw from family and friends; at times you may feel despairing, that there is no point in going on.Anger and rage: some of this may relate to feeling out of control, that everything is chaotic.A sense of injustice and envy: of those who aren\u2019t suffering in this way.Relief: particularly if the person who has died was suffering a great deal. In addition, we may find ourselves affected in some of the following ways: Sleep disturbanceLoss of appetiteRestlessAgitatedPreoccupiedUnable to concentrateIrritableTearful and Exhausted Sometimes there seems to be an expectation that a bereaved person should have recovered after a certain time has elapsed, but everyone has their own recovery time. Help & support Sometimes we realise that something is stopping us from moving forward with our lives. Perhaps we are still grieving intensely, long after the event or we can\u2019t seem to react to the loss at all, perhaps to the point of not being able to cry. In these situations it might be helpful to speak to someone outside of our parents, friends and family. If you\u2019re struggling with feelings after bereavement, counselling may be helpful. Counselling can offer you an opportunity to try to make sense of what is happening and to try to think of how you want to deal with what you feel and think.To get support with the King\u2019s Counselling & Mental Health Service you\u2019ll need to register, or you can make an appointment with your GP for mental health support from the NHS.There are also external organizations you can seek support from: Cruse are an organisation that provide support, information and advice. Their aim is to promote the well-being of bereaved people and to enable anyone bereaved by death to understand their grief and cope with their loss. They also run a forum specifically for young people to share their experiences.Sands is an organisation which offers information and support to anyone affected by the death of a baby.The NHS also have lots of resources to support with mental health including for Grief after bereavement or loss. Traumatic events A trauma is usually an event that is unexpected, shocking or deeply distressing to us. It could be a fire, an accident, a robbery, an attack or being witness to a traumatic event such as a death. It could be a major disaster involving many people, or a personal event involving ourselves, friends or family members. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Most people, in time, get over traumatic experiences without needing help. However, in some people, traumatic experiences set off a reaction that can last for many months or years. This is called Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder or PTSD. There are 3 main symptoms common in PTSD: Flashbacks and nightmares. We find ourselves re-living the event, again and again. This can happen both as a \"flashback\" in the day, and as nightmares when we are asleep.Avoidance and numbing. It can be just too upsetting to re-live our experience over and over again. We might avoid places and people that remind us of the trauma, and try not to talk about it.Being \"on guard\". We may stay alert all the time, as if we are looking out for danger. We can't relax. This is called \"hypervigilance\". Help & support Distress following trauma usually fades with time. However, if you feel that you are making little progress then help is available to aid you in overcoming your problems. If you are struggling with your feelings after a trauma and would like to speak to counsellor please register with the service. Talking to a professional can offer you an opportunity to try to make sense of what is happening to you. Where appropriate we can refer you to specialist support services.Victim Support is an independent charity which helps people cope with the effects of crime. They provide free and confidential support and information to help you deal with your experience.NHS: Post-traumatic stress disorder has an overview of the disorder. Phobias What is a phobia?A phobia is a fear that causes us difficulty in an area of our life, or in our day to day functioning. For example, a fear of needles becomes a phobia when we are unable to have important vaccinations or blood tests.Phobias are extremely common. Sometimes they start in childhood for no apparent reason and sometimes they emerge after a traumatic event. Phobias cause us to feel intense fear and to do our utmost to avoid the feared object or situation.Some common phobias seen in the Counselling Service include a fear of blood, needles, vomiting, of birds, of closed spaces (claustrophobia) or of social or performance situations (social phobia).You might want to consider getting help with your phobia if: It interferes with your ability to lead a full, normal life.It causes you to experience a lot of anxiety or distress and you seem to be feeling like this often.You are avoiding situations that matter.You suffer from overwhelming blushing/trembling/sweating in social situations Help & support If you struggling with a phobia and would like to speak to a Counsellor, please register with the service or make an appointment to see your GP.

In this article: What are eating disorders? Definitions & distinctions Do I have an eating disorder? What are eating disorders? Eating is essential to life. In western societies, most of us have enough to eat and so our relationship with food is no longer just about survival. Our own relationship with food begins when we are babies and often family and social interactions occur in the context of eating. Food takes on a wealth of social, familial, cultural and personal meanings. Eating, for most people, is enjoyable. However, in today\u2019s society we are faced with constant social media images of food, eating and ideal body shapes that complicate our relationship with food and with our bodies. Consequently, it is not surprising that many people, both men and women, and increasingly at an earlier age, develop issues and problems around food. Eating too little or too much, feeling unhappy about their bodies, adopting some compensatory behaviours such as over exercising or purging. Anyone can be affected It seems that both women and men in today\u2019s society, are rarely satisfied with their body shape or weight and most people will diet at some time. Anyone, from all types of background and ethnic groups can suffer from eating disorders. Eating disorders may be a way of coping with feelings that are making you unhappy or depressed. It may be difficult to face up to and talk about feelings like anger, sadness, guilt, loss or fear. An eating disorder is often a sign that you need help in coping with life and sorting personal problems. Do men get eating disorders too? Typically eating disorders are perceived to be conditions that affect only women \u2013 this is far from the case. Between 10% and 25% of those people experiencing eating disorders are male. We know that the majority of men who have eating disorders struggle to get access to appropriate support and treatment. Therefore, it is difficult to know how many men are affected by these conditions. Signs and symptoms may vary Conditions as complex as eating disorders mean that there are variations in the typical signs, and not all symptoms will apply to all people. You may feel that you have a mixture of anorexia and bulimia, or alternate between them. You may find that you are focused on food and exercise and cannot think of much else. Some people also find they are affected by an urge to harm themselves or abuse alcohol or drugs. Eating disorders don\u2019t include food allergies, selective eating issues or disorders of the digestive system. However, a GP should be the first point of call for these issues, as well as for eating disorders. Counselling might be an additional or a first point of contact to talk through these issues further. Definitions & distinctions Eating disorders can be an external expression of internal emotional pain and confusion. Obsessive thoughts about, and the behaviour associated with food (e.g. over exercise, over or under eating, vomiting and purging, social withdrawal etc.) may be \u2018maladaptive\u2019 attempts at processing emotional distress that cannot be otherwise expressed. Often, this emotional distress may be linked to a very negative self-perception, a feeling of being unable to change \u2018bad\u2019 things about oneself. Feelings of being \u2018out of control\u2019 may be overwhelming and food is then often used as a way of taking back some control, until this too becomes an area which is \u2018out of control\u2019. An eating disorder involves a distorted pattern of thinking about food and size and weight, to the extent that there is a preoccupation and obsessive quality to thinking about food, together with an issue of control or lack of control around food and its consumption. There are several recognised eating disorders and areas of disordered eating. Anorexia/Anorexia Nervosa Anorexia is a disorder (or illness) which stems from low self-esteem and an inability to cope safely with worries and problems. It involves lowering food intake by skipping meals and cutting down the types and amounts of foods eaten; some people over-exercise as well. Beliefs such as: \u2019losing weight will make life happier\u2019 may be typical, as well as \u2018people will like me more\u2019, \u2018I will be more successful\u2019 or even perhaps that \u2018I may be noticed less\u2019. Individuals may punish themselves if weight loss is not significant enough, or eat something not usually \u2018allowed\u2019. Losing weight is not the answer to everything. It is important that you try to focus on yourself. Physical symptoms of Anorexia Nervosa Severe weight loss Difficulty sleeping and tiredness Dizziness Stomach pains Constipation Feeling cold Growth of downy (soft and fine) hair all over one\u2019s body (called Lanugo) (girls) Periods stop or don\u2019t start (amenorrhoea) Hair loss Feeling fat when underweight Getting irritable and moody Setting high standards and being a perfectionist Social isolation/ withdrawal Shutting oneself off from the world Thinking things are either right or wrong, there is no in between Difficulty concentrating Behavioural symptoms of Anorexia Nervosa Excessive exercising Having ritual or obsessive behaviours Being secretive Lying about eating Trying to please everyone Cooking or preparing food for everyone else Wearing baggy clothes Bulimia/Bulimia Nervosa Bulimia is also a disorder linked with self-esteem, emotional problems and stress. One may constantly think about calories, dieting and ways of getting rid of the food eaten. Bulimia is actually more common than anorexia, but is more of a hidden illness, because people with bulimia usually remain an average or just over average body weight. Bulimia can go unnoticed for a long time, although one may feel ill and very unhappy. Individuals with Bulimia become involved in a cycle of eating a very large amount of food, making themselves sick (purging), cutting down or starving for a few days or trying to find other ways to make up for the food eaten. Starving causes extreme hunger that then leads to excessively large amounts of food being craved, because your body is craving nourishment.\u00a0 Some people will not vomit but will take laxatives; both behaviours may be described as \u2018purging\u2019 by medical professionals, but taking laxatives is particularly dangerous. Just because bulimia does not cause the extreme weight loss that anorexia does, it does not mean that it is less serious. Help and support is needed. The side effects and consequences of bulimia can be very serious. Physical symptoms of Bulimia Nervosa Sore throat Bad breath and mouth infections Stomach pains Irregular periods (in girls/women) Dry or poor skin Difficulty sleeping Constipation Puffy cheeks Dehydration Fainting Kidney and bowel problems Thoughts and feelings: psychological symptoms of Bulimia Nervosa Feeling emotional and depressed Feeling out of control Mood swings Obsessed with dieting Behaviour Eating large quantities of food Being sick after meals or binges Taking laxatives or diet pills Being secretive and lying Binge Eating Disorder/Compulsive Overeating If you binge eat, this usually means that you would eat large amounts of food in a short period of time (perhaps not at a normal mealtime) and have associated feelings of lack of control during these binges. However, unlike someone with Bulimia Nervosa, you may not try to get rid of the food. You may feel out of control around eating, eat what may be thought of as an unusually large amount of food, eat much more quickly in these binges, eat until feeling uncomfortably full, eat large amounts of food when not hungry, or eat alone. You may well do this for similar reasons to someone with bulimia. Compulsive overeating involves \u2018picking\u2019 at food all day. There may be different reasons why you may do this, but as with eating disorders, food and eating is used as a way of dealing with difficult feelings. If you compulsively overeat or binge eat, you may feel depressed or inadequate because of a lack of control around eating, which can lead to further eating and weight gain. Other Feeding and Eating Disorders (OFED) or Undiagnosed Feeding and Eating Disorders (UFED) Eating disorders are very complex which means that there can be variations in the typical signs and symptoms and that not all of the signs and symptoms will apply to all people. There are many people that may fall into the category of Other Feeding and Eating Disorders (OFED) or Undiagnosed Feeding and Eating Disorders (UFED). These are disorders where one may have some but not all, of the diagnostic signs for Anorexia or Bulimia. You may also be diagnosed with a \u2018partial syndrome\u2019 eating disorder if, for example, a woman with Anorexia has irregular or normal periods, or perhaps, Bulimic episodes are very infrequent. How are Other Feeding and Eating Disorders (OFED) are diagnosed? There are many different behaviours which can help a professional to diagnose OFED. Here are some examples of what some typical diagnoses might include: All the criteria for Anorexia Nervosa are met, except the individual has regular menses or despite significant weight loss, the individual's current weight is within the normal range. All the criteria for Bulimia Nervosa are met except binges occur at a frequency of less than twice a week or a duration of less than three months. An individual of normal body weight who regularly engages in inappropriate compensatory behaviour after eating small amounts of food (e.g. self-induced vomiting after the consumption of two biscuits). An individual who repeatedly chews and spits out, but does not swallow, large amounts of food. Do I have an eating disorder? Conditions as complex as eating disorders mean that there are variations in the typical signs, and not all symptoms will apply to all people.

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01994 Print Where can I get support for grief & bereavement? The death of someone who is significant to us can be one of the hardest things we will experience in life. Whether it\u2019s expected or a shock, the enormity of loss is something that has a profound impact on us. Bereavement can evoke a wide range of feelings, and coping with loss is difficult at any time. However, as a student who may be isolated from family and friends, with other pressures such as deadlines to meet, exams to revise for and potential money worries, it can feel overwhelming. What is grief? Grief is an inevitable and human response to the loss of another person. It can make maintaining our studies, work and personal lives very challenging, and\u00a0may take a long time to work through. Sometimes there seems to be an expectation that a bereaved person should have recovered after a certain time has elapsed, but everyone has their own recovery time. Help is available to you at King\u2019s regardless of when your bereavement happened. Common feelings associated with grief Shock and disbelief: you may feel numb and unable to take in what has happened. Anxiety and panic: sometimes in situations that wouldn\u2019t normally bother you. Guilt and regret: whether for things you wish you had said and done (or not done), or for just being alive. These feelings are particularly strong when someone has died by suicide. An overwhelming sense of loss and sadness: sometimes we may feel as though a part of ourselves has been lost. Depressed: feelings of wanting to withdraw from family and friends, or feeling that there is no point going on. Anger and rage: some of this may relate to feeling out of control, that everything is chaotic. A sense of injustice and envy: of those who aren\u2019t suffering in this way. Relief: particularly if the person who has died was suffering a great deal. Common physical responses to grief Sleep disturbance Loss of appetite Restlessness Agitation Preoccupation Inability to concentrate Irritability Tearfulness Exhaustion Emotional support after a bereavement Bereavement affects people in a variety of ways. Sometimes we realise that something is stopping us from moving forward with our lives. We might be grieving intensely long after the event or unable to react to the loss at all, perhaps to the point of not being able to cry. Grief can be debilitating when you\u2019re a student. You might be struggling to concentrate on your work or find managing social and financial commitments just too much.\u00a0\u00a0If you\u2019re struggling after a loss, it might be helpful to speak to someone outside your immediate circle of friends and family. Use the options below to discover the support available at King\u2019s and beyond. Where can I get support from the King\u2019s community?

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01044 Print I need help finding somewhere to live This guidance is suitable for all students looking for somewhere to live in the private rented sector, at any point of the academic year. For details about student halls, please refer to\u00a0King's Residences. What does renting in the private sector involve? There is generally more choice and flexibility of contracts in the private rental sector, but you may have more processes to follow to secure your home.\u00a0 Make sure you take the time to understand your housing rights and responsibilities before beginning your search. We advise you to check out our Looking for Housing training module to help you get a greater understanding of the housing market so that you can fully evaluate your options. We also suggest looking at the University of London Housing Service's (ULHS) Private Housing Guide. It's packed with really useful information about renting privately in London. What are the best ways to find accommodation? If you're studying in London, a good starting point is to register to use the\u00a0University of London Housing Services\u2019 database\u00a0(ULHS). This contains details of registered landlords and letting agents advertising properties looking specifically for student tenants. Properties for the next academic year are advertised from May onwards. Access to the database is restricted, so you'll need to complete the registration form and provide your King's student ID number. The ULHS website also offers the following helpful resources: The\u00a0Private Housing Guide, which is\u00a0packed with really useful information about renting privately in LondonInformation about their Intercollegiate Halls.\u00a0\u202f\u202f\u00a0Further information in their\u00a0Types of Accommodation guide Private Student Halls The following companies offer private student housing within halls of residence: Unite Student Living Chapter Living Urbanest Property search engines and third-party rent-to-rent providers The following sites are useful when searching for private accommodation in London: Student.Com: Student Accommodation in LondonLondonnesthybrSpotahomeUnilodgersThe Stay ClubiQ Student AccommodationZooplaOnTheMarketRightmove: Student AccommodationStudent SpareroomGumtree \u200b\u200b\u200b Important to know: We do not endorse any of these sites, and they are listed for informational purposes only.Unfortunately, students looking for accommodation are often targeted by scams. Take a look at our article\u00a0Are there any accommodation scams I should be aware of?\u00a0so that you can remain vigilant during your housing search. I'm on a tight budget, where can I find low-cost accommodation? London has one of the highest rates of rent in the UK. Although funding and wages are higher to compensate this, London rents may still seem expensive or outside of your budget limitations. There are some alternatives to an assured shorthold tenancy with a private supplier\u00a0but the accommodation might be more modest, have more rules, less security, or require you to work or take responsibility for the property to offset the cost. Accommodation provided by not-for-profit organisations or registered charities is often cheaper than private rentals, so looking for these can help save you money. See our article Where can I find charity and not-for-profit accommodation for full details. Some students choose to live with a Host Family. This can be a very popular option for students who are new to London and want to get to know the city better before entering a longer term rental contract. Other options include working for your housing provider. These opportunities are available at King's Accommodation, intercollegiate halls and across private suppliers too.\u00a0 This may provide an hourly wage, reduction in rent or free accommodation depending on the role. Please note there are specified recruitment dates for these roles and a requirement to undertake training. Property guardianship is a growing option for Londoners wishing to reduce their rental costs and still live in desirable locations.\u00a0 It's an arrangement by which people are granted cheap accommodation in return for living flexibly, often in desirable locations and unusual properties such as former commercial buildings like pubs, offices, police stations and even historically important properties.\u00a0It is worth researching the Rights of property guardians before you enter into this kind of living arrangement. Your rights are limited and, for old commercial properties, safety and disrepair may be a concern.\u00a0 This form of housing should not be entered without significant attention to the terms of the agreement and standard of the property. When should I book private accommodation? The London housing market is vast and fluid. You can secure accommodation throughout the year and, often, at short notice. Important to know: If you need accommodation in time for the start of the academic year you may find that it is more in demand, and you may need to book something temporary while you explore a longer-term plan. Generally, it's common for people to start looking a few months before needing to move in. \u202fWe advise that you carefully consider your housing needs, budget\u00a0and timescales before committing yourself to a housing contract.\u00a0\u202f\u00a0If you would like to talk through your housing situation, please contact the Money & Housing Advice service. Who should I live with? Renting with other students can bring the cost of housing down. However, good friends don't always make the best housemates. Try to live with people who have similar budgets and attitudes to cleanliness and noise to avoid disagreements.\u00a0This means having a frank and honest conversation with potential flatmates early. If you'd like to live with other students there is a University of London Flatmate finder group that is open to current King\u2019s students. The group is in place to provide a forum for students to find other students looking for accommodation and flatmates. Flatmate finder If you\u2019d like to meet other students to live with, why not try the University of London\u2019s Flatmate Finder group? Its open to all students at institutions associated with the University of London. Our King's Flatmate Finder on Microsoft Teams is exclusively for current King\u2019s students. You can use it to look for housemates to fill an empty room or to search for accommodation. To join, you must have completed your enrolment at King\u2019s and have received your university email address. Both these groups require you to abide by their published codes of conduct.

You need to exercise the same caution as you would if you found an ad on another website/group.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bIf you chose not to live with other students, this will affect your eligibility for Council Tax Exemption. For more detail on this, read\u00a0What is Council Tax and am I exempt from paying it? Where should I live in London? Our Looking for Housing module has a chapter on where to live in London. It includes helpful feedback and testimonials from current students and graduates on where they\u2019ve lived in London. There are also various online resources that can help you find the right area for your needs and budget. The London rents map lists the average monthly rents for different types of home across London. The article Best places to live in London provides a helpful guide to different neighbourhoods. For more information about househunting by area, please read the article Londonnest: Where to live and find accommodation in London as a student? Important to know: King's does not endorse any opinion expressed on external websites. These links are only provided to help you search for accommodation. What should I check for when I'm house hunting? This checklist is designed to help you think about which questions to ask and what to look for when viewing properties. This list is by no means exhaustive but should give you a starting point. Before you look How many rooms? Maximum weekly/monthly rent? Maximum bills? Personal preferences (e.g. want a double room) Location (travel costs vs rent) Viewing inside the property Are the facilities adequate for the number of occupants? Are there adequate washing and toilet facilities? Is there a shower installed? Is the kitchen big enough? (Enough storage space, fridge size etc) How is the water heated?Is your room sufficient for your needs? What furniture does the Landlord supply? Is there sufficient heating, lighting and ventilation?How many electrical sockets are there? Are the communal areas sufficient for your needs? Is there a lounge or somewhere for everyone to sit and eat together? Is there an Internet connection? Are you happy with the overall state of repair and decoration? If not, is the Landlord willing to carry out improvements before you move in? (Get any agreements in writing before committing to anything). Is the house clean? If not, will it be cleaned before you move in? Is there a vacuum cleaner and does it work? Though the Landlord is not obliged to provide this or other domestic appliances, it is useful if they are supplied. Will it be relatively easy and economical to keep the house warm in winter? Ask for an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) if one has not been offered. Ask the current tenants about the heating bills. Does the property suffer from any damp? Attic bedrooms and ground floor rooms are the most susceptible. Feel any outward facing walls/under windows and look behind furniture. Gas, electrical, fire safety & security Are the gas appliances safe? The Landlord is legally obliged to produce a Gas Safety Certificate every 12 Months. Is the electrical wiring safe? Ask the Landlord when the electrical wiring was last checked (broken or old type sockets and loose wiring can often be a bad sign) and ask to see some electrical certification.Is the upholstered furniture fire resistant? The Landlord is legally obliged to ensure all upholstered furniture comply with the Furnishings (Fire Safety) Regulations. The furniture should have labels attached to show this. Are you satisfied that the property is safe in the event of fire? Are there fire doors? How many exits are there from the property? Are there smoke alarms? Is there a fire blanket in the kitchen? Does the Landlord require an HMO License (House of Multiple Occupation)? If you are unsure, seek advice. Is the property reasonably secure? Are there solid external doors? Who has keys to the property? Are there good locks? The best locks have a British Standard \u2018kite mark\u2019.Are there window locks on ground floor and accessible upper floor windows? Has the property been burgled recently? Viewing the outside of the property Is the exterior of the property in good condition? Are there any loose/missing slates on the roof? Are any of the gutters or down pipes blocked? What is the condition of the window frames? Who is responsible for garden maintenance?Is there safe access to the property? At night, is there adequate street lighting? Is there an outside security light? Is there a night bus? Try walking the route from public transport to the front door at night, bring someone with you! Is the area safe after dark? Management of the property & contract Are you happy with the Landlord\u2019s arrangements for doing repairs? What happens if there is an emergency? Who will manage the property - the Landlord or their agent? Have you read and understood your contract? Student Advice and ULHS offer contract checks. Are you clear about the rent, what it includes and when it is due? This should be contained in the contract. How much is the deposit? Have you been informed which tenancy deposit scheme the Landlord is using? If not, ask your Landlord for details. If you don\u2019t receive this information within 30 days of paying the deposit, seek advice as soon as possible. Before you move in Will the rent be split evenly? Who is responsible for each bill? Gas/Electricity/Water/TV Licence/Phone & Cable/Internet/Other How will you pay and what arrangements have been made to split the bills fairly? There are apps which make this hassle free (eg. Splitwise, Venmo). Where can I get further advice on finding somewhere to live? Finding somewhere to live when you\u2019re a student can be very exciting but understanding the private housing sector can be challenge, especially in London.Our Money & Housing Advice team have put together lots of resources to help you in your search: Our online learning module\u00a0Looking for Housing tackles when to start to looking, budget, who to live with, travel and where to look. ULHS have a series of Housing Videos\u00a0about navigating the private rental sector. Once you\u2019ve found somewhere, we recommend recommend learning more about contracts in our module\u00a0Signing a Private Housing Contract, Next Steps. The Money Mentors have tips and advice in their Blog, based on their lived experiences as King's students. If you need help understanding your housing rights and navigating the sector, you can contact the following services for advice and guidance: King\u2019s Money & Housing Advice Service University of London Housing Service Shelter Citizen's Advice Important to know: These services are for advice only. They can\u2019t help you to secure accommodation in the private sector. Similarly, they can\u2019t influence or change decisions made by housing providers without a legal basis to refer to. If you want to live in King\u2019s Residences, Intercollegiate Halls or private halls, you\u2019ll need to speak to the suppliers directly to register your interest in a room.\u00a0Please note that halls of residence usually have strict applications deadlines and can be full and unable to accept more applications, especially at the beginning of the academic year, so it\u2019s important to apply on time. I have specific access requirements due to my health and/or Disabilities, where can I find suitable accommodation? Finding suitable accessible and affordable accommodation in London can be challenging. However, the Equality Act 2010 means that public buildings have to ensure equal access for all to goods and services. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Many student halls, including at King\u2019s Residences, have accessible rooms which students can request by completing the Accommodation Disability Provision form at the registration stage of the booking process.\u00a0Visit the Accommodation Disability Provision webpages to learn more. If you need support explaining your accessibility requirements, our King's Disability Support & Inclusion team can help you. Most hall providers will have a similar policy as part of their registration process. Some of these legislative requirements also extend to private landlords who provide rental accommodation. ULHS has provided more detailed guidance on your rights and links to specialised Housing Associations for students with disabilities on their website. Please note that if you are a home student who claims disability related benefits you may qualify for help with your housing costs throughout the academic year, and further assistance in the summer.\u00a0 For advice of eligibility and to check a claim please contact the Money & Housing Advice Service. Where can I look for family-friendly student accommodation? Unfortunately, there is no family accommodation provided by King\u2019s, but there is alternative family friendly student accommodation available from other providers. We have listed details of these below.\u00a0Alternatively, you can look for suitable private rented accommodation, as described above. Goodenough College Family Accommodation Goodenough College provides residential accommodation in central London for postgraduate taught and research students from all over the world. The College is located in the centre of Bloomsbury and so has excellent transport links. They aim to provide a safe and caring residential community, where students and families can flourish academically and enjoy the extra-curricular activities that they also provide.

This is a read only version of the page. Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01263 Print What are letting agents? A letting agent manages properties for private landlords. Responsibilities range from sourcing tenants and collecting rent, to full responsibility and management.\u00a0It is common for students to find properties through letting agents. Agencies have a wide range of properties and it can be safer than viewing properties with individual landlords. Important to know: Letting agents work for the landlord, to secure the maximum rent possible (and also a higher commission for themselves); they do not work for you. Just because you are using a letting agent does not mean you cannot negotiate on certain terms. You can always try negotiating any deal \u2013 whether for a lower rent or some extra/nicer furniture.Are letting agents regulated?By law, every letting agent should be a member of a redress scheme. This means that if you have a complaint about your letting agent that you are unable to resolve\u202fdirectly,\u202fyou can contact the redress scheme as an independent body. The two redress schemes are: The Property Ombudsman\u00a0The Property Redress Scheme We recommend you only deal with agents who are members of an accreditation scheme. Accredited agents subscribe voluntarily to additional rules and standards above the legal minimum and so you can expect a higher level of service. You can also use these sites to find letting agents in the areas you wish to live: Association of Residential Lettings Agents (ARLA)NAEA PropertymarkNational Approved Letting Scheme (NALS)The Property Ombudsman (TPOS)ULHS Code of Good Practice You can check whether your agent protects landlords\u2019 and tenants\u2019 money through a client money protection scheme through SAFE Agent. You may be at risk of losing your money if the agent is not part of a client money protection scheme. Individual landlords can also sign up to voluntary accreditation schemes. You can check to see if your current or future landlord is accredited at London Landlord Accreditation Scheme.What fees can letting agents charge?Letting agents cannot charge you anything just to register with them, or to show you a list of their properties.

If that\u2019s you, you might be thinking: will I need to keep paying rent in London? These are some of our most common queries and questions: I already have a contract in London but will not be spending the whole year hereI am looking for housing in London, but not a full 12-month contractI\u2019m ending my tenancyAre there any other resources for information on this? Take a look at our information -\u00a0we've outlined\u00a0a range of options for you to consider.I already have a contract in London but will not be spending the whole year hereSublettingOne money savvy solution could be to sublet your room \u2013 but be careful, not all contracts allow it and you carry additional risks as you become the landlord for the person you are subletting to. Important to know: Make sure your contract allows subletting and get permission from your landlord. Subletting without permission is a breach of contract and your landlord could evict you and your subtenantBecoming a landlord through subletting means you have the legal obligations of a landlord. For example, you will need to check that your subtenant has the right to rent in the UK. You could be fined if you don\u2019t carry out these checks.You also become responsible for certain repairs to the property but will be limited in what you can realistically carry out due to not being the property owner. This means you are reliant on your landlord fulfilling their obligations but if they do not this could cause problems for you. AssignmentAn alternative to subletting is assignment. This means that someone takes over your contract through a deed of assignment and this removes your legal liability to the contract. Important to know: You may be asked to pay a fee for assigning a tenancy but following the Tenant Fees Act 2019 this should not exceed \u00a350. If your landlord or agency charges more than \u00a350, you should ask for evidence to demonstrate that their charges are reasonable (for example, if the costs to them are higher than \u00a350).Make sure you, the landlord, any joint tenants and the new tenant sign a deed of assignment to ensure that you are no longer liable for the contract.If you have a joint tenancy, the other tenants (your flatmates) will need to be happy with the replacement as they will be required to sign the deed of assignment. Finding someone to sublet or assign my contract to Ask people you know (friends and course mates) who might be looking for housingYou could use the Flatmate Finder groups run by the University of London Housing Service and KCL to find other interested studentsYou could advertise on websites such as Spareroom I am looking for housing in London, but not a full 12-month contract You could sublet a room from someoneYou might find people looking to sublet a room to someone. Important to know: Check that the landlord who owns the property is aware of the situationCheck that your deposit is properly protected. Your landlord should protect this within 30 days of you paying it. You could take over someone else\u2019s contract (assignment) Important to know: If you are taking over someone else\u2019s contract as they leave, we advise that you: Make sure your deposit is properly protected. Sometimes outgoing tenants will request that you pay the deposit directly to them, but this can cause problems if your name is not added to the deposit protection scheme. Be especially careful to check that there is no damage to the property, or you could end up paying for the damage they caused if this is not dealt with before you sign the deed of assignment. You could use a break clauseA contract with a break clause means that you could end your tenancy early. Your contract will give specific requirements for using the break clause, so make sure you read carefully and follow the instructions if you want to end your tenancy.Important to know: If you have a joint tenancy, all the tenants will need to use the break clause for it to be valid. Other options Lodging with a landlord can be more flexible than other contract types but check the tenancy agreement to make sure.Be careful with flexible \u2018licences\u2019 offered by some landlords and agencies. These can be risky with poor conditions and repairs not carried out, so please contact the\u00a0Money & Housing advice team\u00a0for further advice if you are offered one of these contracts.Student accommodation may offer contracts shorter than one year, but the availability is variable \u2013 try King\u2019s Residences or private halls; for more information you can also check University of London Housing Services. I'm ending my tenancy If you\u2019ve ended your contract through a break clause, assignment, or have simply decided not to renew, there are a few things you need to bear in mind when you leave a property. We have more detail available on moving out but these are the headlines \u2013 Moving out - key things to know: Get your deposit back: It should be returned to you within 10 days of the tenancy ending. Expect any deductions for damage or non-payment of rent to be explained in writing by your landlord. If you have any issues, get in touch with the Money & Housing advice\u00a0team.Take pictures to show the state you left the property in and email them to the landlord on the day you leave.Finalise your bills: Switch off the utilities and take photos of the meter readings (electricity / water / gas).

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01677 Print What is a rent guarantor and how can I get one? Important to know:\u00a0If you're care-experienced or estranged from your parents and you're struggling to find a rent guarantor, please contact the Money & Housing Advice team for support. What is a guarantor? A guarantor is someone who agrees to pay your rent if you\u2019re unable to pay it. Many private landlords and letting agents request that a third-party acts as a guarantor for the rent before they'll agree to let a property to a student. Who can I use as a guarantor? Many students use a parent or a guardian as their guarantor.\u00a0\u00a0Landlords will usually require a UK-based guarantor, which can often be a problem for overseas students. UK citizens may also experience difficulties if they don\u2019t have a family support network or their parents earn under the threshold set by the agent to act as a guarantor. I can\u2019t find a guarantor; what can I do? Negotiate with your landlord or letting agent It can be possible to negotiate with your landlord or letting agent regarding the amount of rent to pay upfront. If you have enough income or funding to cover your rent every month and can provide evidence of this, your landlord may be willing to accept a lower amount of rent in advance.\u00a0\u00a0Important to know: Always ensure that your agreement is confirmed in writing. Private guarantor company Several organisations have been set up to help students without a UK guarantor. You can find qualifying criteria and the terms of service on the guarantor organisation website and check that the agent/landlord will accept this scheme before applying.\u00a0\u00a0Housing Hand and Your Guarantor are two organisations we are aware of that offer a guarantor service to students. Important to know: We are aware of such companies, but please understand that we do not endorse them.\u00a0\u00a0If you would like to talk to us about your options please contact the Money & Housing Advice team and we can provide information and advise you. King\u2019s Residences All new full-time undergraduate and international postgraduate applicants are guaranteed accommodation in the first year of study. This is on the condition that King\u2019s is your firm choice for the next academic year, and provided you submit your accommodation application by the deadline noted on the Residences webpages. Important to know: Care-experienced and estranged students are prioritised for KCL accommodation for the duration of their undergraduate studies. Private student halls There are plenty of private student accommodation providers who are not affiliated with a university. Some of these providers may be more flexible with their guarantor requirements.\u00a0\u00a0These tend to be more expensive, so you should consider whether this is something you can realistically afford before signing a contract with them One guarantor for joint tenants Guarantee agreements are often worded to ensure that the Guarantor has liability for covering the full rent. This means that in joint tenancies they guarantee the rent for all tenants. If you are signing an agreement with others, you can ask if their guarantor is happy to cover the full rent which may mean that you do not have to provide your own guarantor. \u00a0\u00a0Some agencies will insist on all joint tenants having their own guarantor anyway, but you can try to negotiate this.\u00a0\u00a0If one guarantor is not happy to cover the full rent on a joint tenancy, they will need to check that the wording on their agreement limits their liability to just one share of the rent. Advice for care-experienced and estranged students We\u2019re aware that securing a guarantor can be particularly difficult if you are a care-leaver or estranged from your family. Contacting the Money & Housing Advice team can help you understand your options and get vital support. We advise that, regardless of your situation, you get in touch with us as a first step. If you\u2019re a statutory care-leaver under the age of 25, you should also have a personal advisor assigned by your local authority. If you are struggling to access help from your local authority, the charity CORAM: Advice for Young People can advocate for you.

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01714 Print What fees can I be charged when renting in the private sector? When looking to rent a flat or house in the private rental sector, by yourself or sharing with others, it\u2019s important to be aware of the fees you can expect to incur. Likewise, it\u2019s useful to know what you should not be charged for, to help you avoid unnecessary extra fees and costs. For full guidance on this, we recommend completing our online learning module Signing a Private Housing Contract, Next Steps.In 2019 a series of changes to the law were made around renting and fees in the private sector. We\u2019ve put together this updated information for you to refer to when searching for your new home and finalising your contract. These changes to the law will affect you if you\u2019re about to start a new housing contract or if your renewing an existing contract by staying on for another year.In this article we\u2019ll tackle: Which fees are banned?What I can be charged?What costs can be deducted from my deposit?I paid a deposit of 6 weeks' rent. Will I get a refund when I renew my tenancy?Do I still have to pay the check out or inventory fee if it\u2019s stated in my contract?Can the landlord increase the rent for the first few months of the tenancy to cover lost fees?I signed a contract prior to 01 June 2019 but my tenancy started\u00a0after 01 June. Can I get a refund?I\u2019m having an issue with housing fees and need further support Which fees are banned?The Tenant Fees Act 2019 bans certain fees charged to tenants by landlords, letting agents and student accommodation providers. Examples of fees that are banned are: Inventory feesReferencing feesAdditional charges for having a guarantorAdmin feesFees for drawing up a contractCredit check feesFees for new tenancies from 01 June 2019 What I can be charged?Starting a new tenancy; you can expect to be charged: Holding depositDamage depositUpfront rent Are there any other charges that I must pay in a new tenancy? The landlord or agent can charge you a reasonable amount for lost keys, however they must provide evidence. If you are more than 14 days behind on your rent, you can be charged interest limited to 3% above the Bank of England base rate. If you wish to assign your tenancy (transfer it to another person) Government guidance suggests a fee of \u00a350, however, the landlord can charge more if they have evidence of their costs. If you wish to end your tenancy earlier than your fixed term, the landlord can only charge for reasonable costs incurred (for example, advertising costs, rent until they find a new tenant) What costs can be deducted from my deposit?Charges related to being in breach of your tenancy are deducted from your deposit when the tenancy ends. At that point you are able to dispute such charges. If the landlord seeks costs from you prior to the end of the tenancy, they will have to take you to court.\u00a0I paid a deposit of 6 weeks' rent. Will I get a refund when I renew my tenancy?If you renew your tenancy, on 01 June 2020 any deposit money you have paid that exceeds 5 weeks' rent must be refunded. For example, if you paid \u00a3600 deposit and your rent is \u00a3100 a week, your landlord or agent must refund \u00a3100.Do I still have to pay the check out or inventory fee if it\u2019s stated in my contract?If you left your tenancy before 01 June 2020 you will have to pay this fee.Can the landlord increase the rent for the first few months of the tenancy to cover lost fees?Landlords cannot do this however, they can set the rent at a higher rate for the whole period of the tenancy. It will be up to you to research the market for the best value tenancy.I signed a contract prior to 01 June 2019 but my tenancy started\u00a0after 01 June. Can I get a refund?You cannot be refunded for any fees paid before 01 June.\u00a0If you signed an agreement before 01 June, even if the tenancy starts later, none of the bans apply until you renew, or until 01 June 2020. If the contract signed before the 01 June states that you have to pay a renewal fee, you would still have had to pay this fee if you renewed before 01 June 2020. However, the landlord wouldn't be able to include further fees, renewal or otherwise in a future renewal agreement.\u00a0I\u2019m having an issue with housing fees and need further supportIf you have any concerns at all about your experiences of finding accommodation either directly through landlords, student accommodation provider or letting agent, feel free to contact the Money & Housing Advice Team and we will support you.

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01777 Print Who is responsible for repairs and maintenance in my home if I\u2019m renting? All properties require maintenance and from time to time, repairs. It is your responsibility to bring these to your landlord\u2019s attention as soon as they occur. Your tenancy agreement should set out the rights and responsibilities of the landlord and tenant with respect to repairs.This advice is based on the law surrounding repairs. Therefore, if your tenancy agreement stipulates something different, it may be an unfair term that can be disputed. Always seek advice if you have concerns or your home is in disrepair.In this article: Your landlord\u2019s responsibilitiesYour responsibilities Further advice & information Your landlord\u2019s responsibilitiesYour landlord will have a duty to carry out certain repairs. Their obligations will cover: The structure and exterior of the property (including drains, gutters and external pipes) Disrepair to the heating (gas and electricity supplies), water supply and toilet system. If your landlord does not carry out repairs within a reasonable period of time (1-2 weeks depending on the issue), you may have a claim against him for financial damages.Local councils have extensive powers and duties to ensure landlords fulfil their obligations, so you can contact your local Environmental Health Team to carry out an inspection of the property or speak to your local Tenancy Relations Officer for further advice.To find out more about how it works in your area and the contact information, visit your local council\u2019s website or use Find your local council.Your responsibilitiesYou should remember that your landlord is not responsible for all repairs. In some cases, you will be responsible. Your landlord\u2019s obligations do not, for example, extend to cover things like washing machines and fridges and so you should refer to your tenancy agreement to see where responsibility lies.Additionally, you are required to use the premises in a \u201ctenant-like manner\u201d. This means that you are expected to do various jobs about the place.For example: Turning off the water supply if you go away in winter Cleaning the chimneys when necessary Cleaning the windows when necessary Unblocking the sinks when necessary Ensuring that the property is properly ventilated so as not to cause damp/mould (e.g. open window or use extractor fan in the bathroom) If you damage the property, you are responsible for the repairs. If a problem arises, it is important to report it to your landlord in writing. You should date your letter and keep a copy for reference.Important to know: A tenant does not have a general right to withhold rent - even if the landlord fails to carry out repairs. Withholding rent may jeopardise your right to remain in the accommodation. In certain circumstances, a tenant can use the rent to pay for repairs but you should always seek advice before adopting this course of action; contact Money & Housing Advice or the University of London Housing Services.Further advice & informationIf you are unsure about anything related to your rights as a tenant, your contract or dealing with your landlord or letting agency, we have lots of articles to support you in our Housing & accommodation support.

Anyone who doesn\u2019t hold British or Irish nationality must provide evidence that they have a valid immigration permission for the UK. Landlords are required to perform and approve a right to rent check up to a maximum of 28 calendar days before the start of your tenancy agreement. I have a valid Student visa and have a BRP/Digital Status You can generate a share code which evidences your right to rent. Your landlord then needs to use the share code to complete an online right to rent check. Landlords can no longer rely on a BRP to perform a manual right to rent check. I have a Student visa entry vignette, but I haven\u2019t collected my BRP yet You can show your landlord your visa vignette. Your landlord can sign a tenancy agreement if they\u2019ve performed a manual right to rent check on your visa vignette. \u00a0Your landlord will be required to perform an online check (within 30 days of the manual check) to complete their right to rent records. I\u2019m in the UK, I\u2019ve applied for a new Student visa and I\u2019m still waiting for the decision You can provide your landlord with evidence that you\u2019ve submitted a valid visa application while inside the UK, e.g., the document checklist or email acknowledgement you receive after submitting your online visa application. Your landlord will be required to perform an online check to determine your right to rent. I'm in the UK as a Visitor I have a Visitor visa vignette in my passport Your landlord can perform a manual right to rent check using your Visitor visa vignette. I wasn\u2019t required to apply for my visa before travelling to the UK If you were given a stamp on your passport when you entered the UK, you\u2019ll be able to provide your landlord with your passport and valid entry stamp to evidence your right to rent. If you weren\u2019t given a stamp on your passport, you can provide your landlord with your passport together with evidence of the date you entered the UK (e.g., flight ticket, boarding pass). Your landlord can perform a manual right to rent check using these documents. I\u2019m outside of the UK and I haven\u2019t received my Student visa yet Unfortunately, you\u2019ll need to wait until you\u2019ve received your Student visa and it is valid to evidence your right to rent. Important to know: your Student visa will only be valid for travel up to a maximum of 1 month before your programme start date. The right to rent guidance for landlords says that a landlord can agree a tenancy in principle\u2019 before the person enters the UK. However, they\u2019re still required to perform the right to rent check within 28 days before the official tenancy start date.

Council Tax exemption has traditionally only been possible for full-time students.What is the definition of a full-time student for Council Tax purposes?To count as a full-time student, your course must: Last at least one calendar or academic year, where you\u2019re required to undertake the course for at least 24 weeks out of the year.Normally require at least 21 hours of study, tuition or work experience per week during term time. How are distance learning courses defined?Distance learning courses are officially considered part-time by King\u2019s.\u00a0As such, any letter we issue needs to be clear about the mode of study.As a distance learner, you have a greater degree of flexibility over how and when you study, but you are only deemed to be \u2018actively\u2019 studying when you are enrolled on a module.Each module usually takes between 6 \u2013 8 weeks to complete and each module will have a credit value. The credit value will have an equivalent number of \u2018notional\u2019 study hours, and this is what we use to calculate how many hours of study per week you are expected to be doing. To find out what this is, you are best to contact your department.Definitions in lawCouncil tax eligibility and exemption is set in law and not something which is decided by King\u2019s or any university. This means we cannot determine if you definitely are or are not eligible. We can only explain the eligibility criteria and help to identify if you are likely or unlikely to fit that criteria and explain why. But the decision on your eligibility for exemption will always sit with your local authority.Overall, courses which are defined as part-time are usually not regarded as eligible for council tax exemption since they don\u2019t usually meet the criteria for 21 hours+ over 24 weeks+, as outlined above. However, there have been occasions where this legal definition has been challenged and it has been found that there are courses which meet the criteria for study time and could be deemed eligible. If you would like to find out more about this in detail, there are examples in case law:Valuation Tribunal L V-S and Royal Borough of Kingston Upon Thames 21/03/2019 Can Student Services give me a letter to apply for Council tax exemption?Yes, we can issue you with a letter, and you can use it to apply for Council tax exemption if you wish.Your letter will contain the following: A statement confirming you are studying as a distance learning student, and that this is considered part-time by the universityYour course nameYour overall course start and expected end datesThe module you are currently studying and the start dateAny other modules you have already studiedAn explanation of how many weeks you have studied or are expected to study, and a calculation of the expected study hours per week We will liaise with your department directly to confirm the dates of your study on current or past modules within the current academic year.Important to know: We can only issue letters confirming factual information confirmed by your record and departmentWe can only represent your status and information as it is at the date of issue, i.e. your record as it is \u2018now\u2019.It is your responsibility to update your local authority with information which may affect your eligibility if your situation changes (if exemption is granted).Issuing you with a letter does not mean you are eligible or that you will be granted exemption. It is up to your local authority to decide if you are eligible.If you are currently in receipt of welfare benefits, making the case that you are a full-time student may remove your eligibility for means tested benefits.\u00a0 You are strongly advised to seek specialist local advice, if this your situation. How can I get support and advice on this?As with determining eligibility for any benefit, determining eligibility for council tax exemption can be complex if you are not classified as a \u2018full-time\u2019 student.

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01042 Print What is Council Tax and am I exempt from paying it? What is Council Tax? Council Tax is a charge made by Local Authorities to all households within their borough. The value of the property and the number of residents within it will generally determine how much is charged from year to year. It funds services such as libraries, refuse collection, policing and fire services. It can be an expensive bill, but luckily most\u00a0full-time\u00a0students don\u2019t have to pay it. This is called\u00a0\u2018Council Tax Exemption\u2019. Who is exempt? Full-time students are exempt, and to count as full-time for purposes of Council Tax Exemption, your course must: Last at least 1 calendar or academic year, where you\u2019re required to undertake the course for at least 24 weeks out of the year; Normally require\u00a0at least 21 hours of study, tuition or work experience per week during term time.Important to know: You will only be eligible for Council Tax Exemption during your official course dates, as stated on your student record. This means that when you start your course and apply for exemption, you'll only be eligible from your official start date, which will be on your record and appear on your Confirmation of Study Letter. How does my living situation affect Council Tax? I live in university Halls of Residence If you are living in university Halls of Residence you will not need to pay, as they are classed as buildings \u2018occupied only or mainly by students\u2019. However, some private companies that provide \u2018student-type\u2019 accommodation (including some of the intercollegiate halls) may attract a charge. King\u2019s Residences are exempt from Council Tax, but other student accommodation might\u00a0not be, so you should check with them before you sign up to anything. You might\u00a0need to provide evidence of your full-time student status to your accommodation provider as well as the Local Authority/Council. I live in a private residence If you live in a house or flat where everyone is a full-time student, you don\u2019t have to pay Council Tax.You should apply for exemption upon moving in. This can be done by sending a copy of your Confirmation of Study letter to your local council. Find out how in\u00a0I need to prove my student status.Some students, however, may have to pay or contribute to this bill.This will depend on: The type of property you live inWho else lives in the propertyYour mode of study I live with non-students; will I have to pay Council Tax? If you live with one other adult who is not a full-time student, the property you are in will likely be charged for Council Tax. You might be able to get the rate reduced by 25% by informing your Local Authority that you (as an individual) are exempt. If you live with more than one non-full-time student, however, then the property will be liable for the full Council Tax charge.Important to know: Your student status means that you are not legally liable to pay Council Tax. But, if you live with non-students then they might\u00a0still expect you to contribute towards the bill. It's important to discuss this with potential flatmates before you commit to living together. Does my visa status affect Council Tax? I'm an EU/international student, am I exempt from UK Council Tax? EU and international students are treated the same as Home students regarding\u00a0Council Tax. If you live in a property attracting a Council Tax charge then you might\u00a0have to pay, regardless of the fact you are not a UK national.\u00a0\u00a0If you bring a partner with you to the UK on a visa, then they will be exempt from Council Tax charges provided their visa states that they have \"no recourse to public funds\"\u00a0or \"no right to work\". Important to know: Make sure you send evidence of these restrictions to your Local Authority so that they are aware.This does not apply to dependents who are EEA or Swiss Nationals, British Nationals or those who have Indefinite Leave to Remain in the UK themselves. I\u2019m an exchange student, am I exempt from UK Council Tax? If you are an exchange student who is studying full-time but will attend King\u2019s for less than an academic year, then\u00a0you might\u00a0still qualify for exemption if your home\u00a0educational establishment is situated\u00a0in a Member State of the\u00a0European Union.Our\u00a0Money & Housing Advice team\u00a0are very experienced in support students with council tax enquiries, so please contact them if you need support.

I'm a part-time student Students registered on a part-time course can't claim exemption and will have to pay Council Tax.If you're registered on a full-time course\u00a0but have a period of part-time attendance,\u00a0then you should still qualify for exemption.\u00a0You might\u00a0be eligible for\u00a0Council Tax Reduction\u00a0if you are a part-time student and on a low income. If you think either of these scenarios apply to you, then\u00a0please contact our\u00a0Money & Housing Advice team. I\u2019ve taken a break and interrupted my studies If you interrupt your studies, you should still retain your student status for Council Tax purposes if you were previously enrolled as a full-time student.You will remain a student until you complete, withdraw or are expelled from the course.While interrupted, your automatic Confirmation of Study letter won\u2019t work for you; this is because it\u2019s programmed only to work for fully enrolled students.

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01043 Print When do I become liable to start paying Council Tax? You become liable for Council Tax from the day after your official course end date; this is the date on your student record, and appears as your \"expected end date\" on university documentation and your student ID card. So, for example, if you've graduated\u00a0from King's during the 2023-24 academic year and your expected end date was 4 June 2024, you would\u00a0become liable from 5 June 2024.\u00a0Postgraduate taught (PGT) students with an official end date of 30\u00a0September 2024 will be liable for Council Tax on 1 October 2024.\u00a0For further information about how your course dates and student status are worked out, please also refer to: Academic CalendarUnderstanding student status: Finishing your studies What if I\u2019ve been given an extension? If your course end date has been officially extended, you'll need to download and send a updated Confirmation of Study letter which shows your updated expected end date, to prove that your enrolment with King's has not yet\u00a0ended.\u00a0Important to know: If you've been permitted more time to submit work this is\u00a0not\u00a0an official extension of the course, and it will be at your Council's discretion whether or not to apply student exemption for longer.If you've been granted more time to complete your assessments or have deferred exams to the August\u00a0session, please ask log a case and ask us to confirm these details with your department and add this information to a letter.Please provide as much detail as possible about what you need and why when logging your case.However, the Council is not obligated by law to extend your exemption because the regulations define a student as: \"You are a student from the day you begin the course until the day you complete it, abandon it or are no longer permitted by the educational institution to undertake it.\" Can I challenge a rejection for Council Tax Exemption? There have been a number of valuation tribunals that have looked at the issue of deferred assessments and resitting, and quite often the test is how similar to full-time study this extension period is. If you wish to pursue an exemption for Council Tax on these grounds, and you have already submitted an tailored letter which has been rejected, you are advised to consult the\u00a0Money & Housing Advice Team\u00a0or\u00a0local advice agency\u00a0on case law which would support your case or an application for welfare benefits. Do I have to pay Council Tax in the gap between courses? Yes. If you have completed a foundation programme, first degree or masters and plan to start a new course in next academic year, your exemption from Council Tax as a student\u00a0does not continue\u00a0during this gap and you will need to pay the bill.Councils usually issue a bill for the full tax year showing the amount owing from the point you become liable until 31 March the next year. Arrange with your council to pay monthly. Once you have enrolled on the new course, you can submit evidence of your student status and they will then apply your exemption again from the start of the new programme.Your bill for the year will be recalculated.You will then have a balance to pay or be issued with a refund for any over payments. Important to know:\u00a0Failure to pay Council Tax can have\u00a0serious consequences.If you experiencing financial hardship you can seek advice from your council, and from our guidance in\u00a0I'm having money difficulties, where can I find support?

There are several reasons why someone may become homeless, this can be caused by illegal eviction, loss of income, domestic violence, relationship breakdown or a change in family circumstances. This article outlines the support available if you become homeless, or are at risk of homelessness, during your studies. When is someone considered to be homeless? The term homelessness can be applied to a number of scenarios: Street homelessStaying temporarily with friends or family (commonly known as sofa surfing)Staying in a hostel, night shelter or B&BSquatting (because you have no legal right to stay)At risk of violence or abuse in your homeLiving in poor conditions that affect your healthLiving apart from your family because you don't have a place to live together The Homelessness Reduction Act 2017 outlines the legal duties of English councils to provide meaningful help to everyone who is homeless or at risk of homelessness. If you are; sofa surfing, in temporary accommodation, a victim of domestic violence, recently evicted with nowhere to go or at risk of homelessness in the next 8 weeks, and are unable to secure your own accommodation you should make an application for homelessness with your local authority.\u00a0They have a duty to help you even if you have no recourse to public funds. Although local councils have a legal duty to help people that present as homeless, not everyone gets help with housing, some people just get advice on how to find a home. For more information, read Shelter\u2019s guide to asking for homeless help from the council. Important to know: You are not considered to be homeless if you have not yet secured appropriate student accommodation but have a home which you can commute to each day outside of London, or you have just arrived in London and are looking for somewhere to live. For advice and guidance on your housing options read our article I need help finding somewhere to live. I\u2019d like to secure student accommodation but need some help If you are homeless but have the financial means to secure your own accommodation for students and need some advice on finding somewhere suitable, visit our guidance module on looking for somewhere to live. You can also contact the Money & Housing Advice Service to talk through your situation and assess the best options for you. If you\u2019re interested in King\u2019s Residences, you can register your interest using their online application portal. King\u2019s accommodation is not guaranteed outside of the usual application cycle which secures accommodation for the academic year. Rooms can become available throughout the year but you may need to wait for a suitable room to become available. King\u2019s Residences are unable to accommodate students who are dormant or on break from study as they don't meet the criteria for the tenancy agreement (i.e. registered and attending a full-time course of study). Important to know: Once you have signed an agreement you are committed to it for the full length of your tenancy or licence agreement, so be confident that the accommodation meets your needs and budget before committing yourself to it. If you have any concerns about this consult a Housing Advisor before signing an agreement. I\u2019m in immediate need with nowhere to stay tonight Your options will depend on your budget and when you became homeless. If possible, contact a housing advisor at King\u2019s, or a local or national housing advice service to discuss your personal situation before committing yourself to any particular course of action: Search for local housing advice agencies: Turn2UsSearch for local housing solicitors (recommended if you have been illegally evicted): Law SocietyNational charities with helplines: Crisis 0300 636 1967 and Shelter 0808 800 4444 If you have available funds consider arranging temporary accommodation with a short stay provider such as a\u00a0youth hostel\u00a0or budget hotel, until you have had the opportunity to speak to a Housing Adviser or your local council. For a homeless shelter you will need a referral and should follow guidance by Shelter: Get a place to stay if you're homeless and on the streets. If you can't pay for temporary accommodation and have no one whom you can stay with, contact King\u2019s Student Services (during office hours 09.00-17.00) or King\u2019s Security (outside office hours) who will raise your case as a \u2018Student of Concern\u2019. This\u00a0will trigger the university support services to coordinate support for you. It's essential that you provide details on how to contact you and you answer your phone. How can King\u2019s help and support me? If you experience a housing crisis and are homeless (e.g. if you have been evicted from your accommodation without notice or you are fleeing violence) you or another member of the King\u2019s community (staff or student) should inform the university that you are at risk using the \u2018Student of Concern\u2019 process. This will trigger support services to provide co-ordinated support for you relating to your housing, money and mental health. You will be connected with a Welfare and/or Housing Advisor to assess your case and discuss your options with you. They will help you to access additional specialist services as needed: If you need financial assistance you can apply to university hardship funds; where appropriate emergency loans can be requested through the Welfare, Money & Housing Advisors to provide some short-term relief to financial crisis while a full assessment for financial support is undertakenIf you need emergency accommodation, they will help you to assess your options inside and outside the universityYou can discuss the immediate and longer-term impact on your studies with them,\u00a0if you\u00a0need to take some time off or\u00a0submit mitigating circumstances for affected assessmentsSignposting to mental health services and linking up with your GP, Social Services and other internal or external departments as appropriate If you need support out of hours, check our article Housing and homelessness advice when the university services are closed.

We advise that you email any proposed contracts to Advice\u00a0so an Adviser can review\u00a0the document. In this article: What is a housing contract? Common types of contract for studentsCommon terms to be aware of in contracts We also recommend learning more about contracts in our module\u00a0Signing a Private Housing Contract, Next Steps. What is a housing contract? The contract is a document that you sign when you start a tenancy agreement and it is legally binding. Therefore, it is important that you read it carefully and understand your rights and responsibilities. Both King\u2019s College London and the University of London Housing Service provide free contract-checking services, so it is always a good idea to speak to an adviser if you are unsure.If you are renting from a private landlord, the most common types of tenancy are: Assured Shorthold Tenancy\u00a0Licence Agreement\u00a0(living with your landlord or private student halls) It is sometimes possible to have a different type of tenancy than the one stated on your agreement. The reality of the living situation determines the type of tenancy you have, not just what is written at the top of your contract. If you are unsure,\u00a0seek advice. You can also refer to the Shelter Tenancy Checker. Common types of contract for students Assured Shorthold Tenancies (ASTs) Most student tenancies are Assured Shorthold Tenancies (AST). Amongst other things, this will mean that: You have exclusive right to occupy the tenanted room or house.You are entitled to \u201cquiet enjoyment\u201d of the premises without being disturbed by the landlord.If you have agreed to rent for a fixed term, you have the right to occupy for at least the duration of the fixed term and you will be unable to end your tenancy before the end of the fixed term unless you have negotiated a break clause.Landlords have a legal duty to protect your tenancy deposit. Landlords can gain possession of the property at the end of the fixed term (or after 6 months if there was no fixed term agreed), but you are entitled to at least 2 months\u2019 notice (in writing) that possession is required. Important to know: You cannot be evicted unless the landlord obtains a court order. For more information, visit\u00a0Shelter: Eviction process ASTs can either be granted to an individual, so that only they have the right to occupy their room, or to joint tenants, who together have the exclusive right to occupy the property. Licence In some cases, the agreement you sign with a landlord may be a licence and not a tenancy. The main difference is that you don\u2019t have exclusive possession under a licence, and therefore may have less protection from eviction than under a tenancy. Important to know: A landlord also has no legal requirement to protect your deposit under a licence. Licences may typically include cleaning services and are typically used when you are living with the landlord in their home. Living with a LandlordIf you are planning to rent a room in a landlord\u2019s home and share facilities with them, you will likely be a lodger. Generally, you have fewer rights as a lodger, and you should ensure you have a written contract with the landlord setting out the rights and responsibilities you both have. Please contact the Money & Housing Advice for further information. Common terms to be aware of in contracts Joint Tenancy If you are signing an agreement with more than one tenant, this will mean you have a joint tenancy. Joint tenants have joint and shared liability for the contract. This means that the landlord can ask you to pay for your housemates unpaid rent or costs for repairing damage caused by your housemate.\u00a0If one tenant leaves, it will be the tenants\u2019 responsibility to find a replacement tenant or pay the additional rent. This means you have greater control over who you share your property with compared to when you have an individual tenancy. Joint tenants will also have exclusive possession of the whole property, meaning the landlord will need to ask permission to enter the property. Individual Tenancy This is when each tenant has their own tenancy agreement with no other tenant names listed on it and you are only responsible for paying your share of the rent. If you have an individual tenancy in a shared flat/house, you will have exclusive possession of only your room. This means that the landlord can enter the communal areas of the property without permission. You will not have any control over who else lives in the property. Right to Rent Check From February 2016 landlords are required to complete a right to rent immigration check for every new tenant over the age of 18 living in the property. You must prove to your landlord, or their managing agent, that you have the right to stay in the UK. A landlord or letting agent can\u2019t let you a property if you can\u2019t show you have the right to rent. You have the right to rent if you are: British A citizen of an EU or EEA Country A citizen of another country with no time limits on your permission to live in the UK If you have a valid visa for work, study, or as a spouse of someone settled in the UK, you have a time-limited right to rent, for the duration of your visa.\u00a0For detailed guidance, refer to our article\u00a0I'm an international student and need to prove my right to rent. Tenant Fees Most letting agent fees for tenants were banned from June 2019. As a result, you can no longer be charged for administration, referencing, credit or immigration checks.You can still be charged to change your tenancy or assign it to someone else after you have signed the tenancy agreement, but in most cases this should only be \u00a350. If you are charged more than this, the agency will need to show evidence of their costs.If you are unsure whether your agency is charging a prohibited fee or if there are prohibited fees listed in your contract, check our article What fees can I be charged when renting in the private sector? Break Clause You may have a\u00a0break clause\u00a0in your contract, which allows either you or the landlord to end the tenancy before the end of the fixed term. The clause\u00a0must\u00a0give both you and your landlord exactly the same rights.It is important to consider whether a break clause is in your best interest before agreeing. It can be useful if you are not sure if you want to stay in the property for a full year, but it could be really inconvenient if the landlord decides to use the break clause during your exams!If you are on a joint contract, the break clause would end the entire tenancy for your flatmates too, so you would all need to be in agreement for this to work.If your contract has a break clause, it is a good idea to seek advice as they can be badly written and may not be enforceable. Implied Terms Landlords and tenants have certain rights and responsibilities given by law, these do not have to be written in the tenancy agreement for them to exist. Your contract can give both you and your landlord more than your statutory rights, but it cannot give you less than your statutory rights. If there is a term in your contract which gives you less than your statutory rights, it is likely to be an unfair term and cannot be enforced.

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01843 Print Travelling to the UK as a Visitor Can I study on a Standard Visitor visa? The Standard Visitor visa is the most appropriate visa option if you're currently outside of the UK and wish to undertake one of the following: A course of up to 6 months (including short periods of study, e.g. attending a weekend course, viva or resit exam) \u00a0A medical elective period in the UK of up to 6 months that is linked to a medical, veterinary medicine, dental or scientific degree-level course at an overseas Higher Education Provider (HEP)A study abroad programme of up to 6 months which is part of a programme you're currently studying at an overseas institutionA period of research or receiving research tuition of up to 6 months, which will be used towards a qualification at degree level or above that you're currently studying at an overseas institutionResit exams which are held after your Student visa has expiredAttend the graduation ceremony for your course if your Student visa expires before the date of the ceremony. Important to know:\u00a0If you have deferred (not resit) exams, you can't attend them on a Standard Visitor visa. You must apply for a Student visa instead. How do I apply for the Standard Visitor visa? The process for applying for a visa to come to the\u00a0UK depends on whether you're a visa national or a non-visa national. To find out which one you are, please refer to the\u00a0Visa national list of the UKVI\u2019s Immigration Rules Appendix Visitors. If your country of nationality is not on this list, you're a non-visa national. If you're a visa national You'll need to apply online before travelling to the UK. You can apply in any country apart from the UK. The earliest you can apply is 3 months before you travel. If you're a non-visa national You don't need to apply for this visa prior to travelling to the UK, but you can request entry as a Standard Visitor at the UK border. However, you may want to apply for a visa in advance if you'll be making multiple trips outside of the UK or you've previously received a visa refusal. In addition,\u00a0some non-visa nationals will require an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) in advance of travel. This won't be required if you apply for a Standard Visitor visa in advance. When you arrive in the UK, you'll need to show an immigration officer all of your supporting documents (see below). At this point, your passport should be stamped. This stamp is considered to be your visa. If you're a national from the EU, Australia, Canada, Iceland, Japan, Lichtenstein, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland or the United States, you can enter via an E-Gate. If you haven't received a stamp in your passport and entered via an E-Gate, you'll need to provide a copy of your boarding pass or flight ticket to evidence your arrival in the UK before you can enrol at King\u2019s.We would advise non-visa nationals to keep evidence of entry and exit dates (e.g. flight tickets) in case you need this information in the future.\u200b You can find further guidance on applying for the Standard Visitor visa on the UK Council for International Student Affairs (UKCISA) webpages.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b What documents will I need to provide during my application? You'll need to submit the following original documents with your application: Current passport\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bVisa support letter issued by King\u2019s College London:New students (e.g. Study Abroad, electives, summer schools and new distance learners): this will be issued via the King's Apply portalCurrent students (e.g. resit students, distance learners mid-degree): this can be requested using the Visitor Letter Request Form - Current StudentsStudent/alumni attending graduation ceremonies: see our article Visa assistance for your graduation ceremony\u00a0Evidence that you have enough money to support yourself during your stay in the UK. There are no specific requirements for how much this will be, but you will need to calculate tuition fees, accommodation, travel and living expenses (we would recommend showing at least \u00a31334 per month living expenses) for the duration of your stay.If you are under 18, you need to provide additional documentation; please refer to our guidance on this. For further guidance on the supporting documents\u00a0you'll need, please visit\u00a0UKVI's Visiting the UK: guide to supporting documents webpage. I'm under 18; do I need additional documentation? Yes. You will need to provide additional documents with your application which provides evidence of who your parents/legal guardians are, and of your relationship with them.\u00a0 This will be documents such as: Your parents/legal guardian\u2019s passport; andA birth certificate/adoption certificate I\u2019m travelling without parents or guardiansIf you\u2019re not travelling with your parents, you are required to provide evidence that shows you have adequate arrangements for your travel to, and arrival in the UK, and your care during your stay in the UK.This should include: A signed letter from your parents/guardians confirming they give consent for the arrangements made for you.Confirmation of who is travelling with you (including copies of their passport), or who will meet you when you arrive in the UK.Confirmation of where you will live and who will care for you whilst you are in the UK. Do I need to apply for ATAS? You may need ATAS clearance if you're studying certain research subjects. Your offer letter should include this information. If your course requires ATAS, you will need to apply before you start your course. For further guidance, read our article\u00a0Do I need ATAS clearance before I start my course at King's? Visa conditions & restrictions If you have applied for your visa prior to travelling to the UK, you should be issued with a multiple entry visa. Non-visa nationals who received a stamp in their passport on entry or have entered via the E-Gate will only be issued a single-entry visa. The Standard Visitor visa has the following restrictions: You can't work in the UK (paid or unpaid), including work placements or internshipsYou can't undertake any business activity in the UK Any family members\u00a0can't be sponsored as your dependent(s) - they must apply for their own Visitor visa(s)You can't spend more than 6 months in the UK as a Visitor within one 12-month periodYou can't claim any public funds in the UK You can't study a course that is longer than 6 monthsYou can't access the National Health Service (NHS) for freeYou can't extend your visa or switch into another visa category in the UK. Do I need to have health insurance? If you're coming to the UK on a visa that is for less than 6 months and you didn't pay the Immigration Health Surcharge, you won't be able to use the NHS for free. We strongly recommend that you purchase health insurance to cover you during your stay. Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) Some nationals are required to get an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) before travelling to the UK if they haven't applied for a visa in advance of travel. This is a form of 'pre-screening' that gives permission to travel. This is not permission to enter - you'd still need to be permitted entry as a visitor on arrival to the UK, and you'd still be subject to the conditions of a Standard Visitor visa. You can make an application online. If your application is refused you can't apply again, but you could apply for a Standard Visitor visa in advance of travel. An ETA will allow multiple entries within a 2-year period. However, the restrictions on time spent in the UK as a visitor will still apply. Important to know: your passport will need to be valid for the duration of your stay when you apply for an ETA.

Once you've received your ATAS certificate, you must remember to submit your visa application before your certificate expires. Important to know: You'll also be asked to provide your ATAS certificate as part of the enrolment for your course. What if 30 working days have passed and I haven't received my ATAS certificate?

To request a CAS through Student Services Online: Complete the CAS request form. You\u2019ll be prompted to sign in.Answer some questions that will help the Visa Compliance team process your request and issue your CAS.Click \u2018Submit\u2019. Student Services will then process your request and contact you if they have any further questions. Important to know: If you\u2019re an applicant and you\u2019ve received an unconditional offer to study a course at King\u2019s, then you\u2019ll receive your CAS through your King\u2019s Apply account. Check out our article on how to request your CAS as an applicant.If you've\u00a0completed your studies and want to apply for a Graduate visa, you don\u2019t need a new CAS. You need to wait for our Visa Compliance team to send you confirmation via email that they\u2019ve notified UKVI of your successful completion. King\u2019s will do this within 10 working days of your results being formally ratified at the relevant assessment board. Completing the CAS request form The CAS request form asks if I intend to submit my application from inside or outside the UK. Why? We ask you about where you intend to apply for your visa as it helps us accurately complete the CAS. The CAS informs UKVI about your visa start date and other important information. Important to know: It is very important to tell us if you change your mind about where you\u2019re going to apply. For example, if you initially plan to apply from within the UK but later decide to apply from your home country, we might need to adjust the CAS start date.To be eligible to apply for your Student visa inside the UK, you must meet UKVI\u2019s academic progression requirements. If you\u2019ve got any questions about this, please contact our Visa & International Student Advice team. The CAS request form asks if I\u2019ve studied in the UK before on a Student/Tier 4 visa. Why do you need to know this? If you\u2019ve studied in the UK before on a Student visa and you want to apply for your Student visa extension in the UK, then you must meet UKVI\u2019s academic progression requirements. Providing us with this information about your previous studies will help us to accurately document your academic progression on the CAS for UKVI purposes. This ensures compliance with UKVI\u2019s requirements. We also need to declare on the CAS how you meet the academic progression requirements, so knowing if you\u2019ve studied in the UK before on a\u00a0Student/Tier 4 visa will help us to make sure that the information on your CAS is correct for UKVI. I\u2019m unsure about which option I should choose for my visa extension If you're unsure about the most suitable option for your visa extension, please select the option that fits your situation best. Afterwards, please provide extra information about why you're requesting a CAS in the section 'Please use the space below to provide any additional information you would like to share with us'. I don't know\u00a0when my visa expired/will expire. What date should I put on the CAS request form? Enter 01/01/2000 as your visa expiry date. This lets us know that either your visa has already expired or you\u2019re uncertain about your current visa\u2019s expiry date. I only have one name on my passport - will this be a problem? What should I write? This won\u2019t be a problem. On the CAS request form, please write your full name as written on your passport. We can then make sure that your CAS matches your passport. After completing the CAS request form When will I receive my CAS after completing the form? We aim to provide your CAS within 4 weeks of your request, although we often deliver it sooner. If your CAS is urgent, please email our Visa Compliance team and we'll try to prioritise your request. I\u2019ve been waiting for my CAS for a few days and haven\u2019t heard anything. Should I make another CAS request on Student Services Online? To avoid further delays, please don\u2019t submit another CAS request. Generating your CAS requires speaking with multiple departments to gather all the needed information. If your CAS is urgent, please email our Visa Compliance team and we\u2019ll try to prioritise your request. I entered the wrong passport number on the CAS request form. Do I need to submit a new request? If you notice that the passport number listed on your CAS is wrong, please email us immediately. I've received my extension CAS via email. Do I need a PDF version of my CAS? A CAS is a virtual document that provides you with information to help you complete your visa application and is shared with UKVI. You don\u2019t need a PDF version of your CAS for your visa application. Common questions How can I change information in my CAS? Once you receive your CAS, it\u2019s important to check it carefully and inform us immediately if you notice any errors. You shouldn\u2019t use the CAS to apply for your visa until you\u2019re certain that all of the information is correct. It\u2019s especially important to check: Personal detailsPassport numberCourse end dateCourse title and levelIf you need ATAS Please email our Visa Compliance team with a description of the change(s) that you\u2019d like to be made to your CAS. Many common changes can be made through the addition of a sponsor note. I want to apply for a Graduate visa. Should I request a new CAS to do this?

If you\u2019re a Student visa holder on a full-time course, there are restrictions on the number of hours you can work and also the type of work you can do. Important to know: if you hold a Student visa for a part-time course, you don\u2019t have the right to undertake any paid or unpaid work in the United Kingdom. Hours you can work Your visa should state if you can work during your studies. Your work condition includes any paid work, unpaid work, voluntary work and internships. If your course of study is at a degree level or above, you can work up to a maximum of 20 hours per week during term-time, and full-time during vacations.If your course of study is below degree level, you can work a maximum of 10 hours per week during term-time, and full-time during vacations. Vacation periods UndergraduateYou can work full-time during vacation periods at Christmas, Easter and during the summer. Please check your programme\u2019s term dates so that you\u2019re aware of when you\u2019re allowed to work full-time. You can also work full-time for four months after you\u2019ve completed your course. Postgraduate taughtYou can work full-time during the Christmas and Easter vacation periods only. You can\u2019t work for more than 20 hours per week during the summer because you\u2019re still classed as being in full-time study while you\u2019re working on your dissertation. The summer period counts up until 30 September, even if you submit your dissertation earlier than this date. You\u2019re allowed to work full-time for 4 months from 1 October. Postgraduate researchThere are no set vacation periods for postgraduate research students. Instead, you\u2019ve got a set amount of weeks each year that you can take off as a vacation period. You\u2019ll be able to work full-time during any vacation periods you officially agree with your supervisor. Types of work you can't do As a Student visa holder, you\u2019re not allowed to: be employed as a doctor in training (except on a recognised foundation programme)be employed as a professional sportsperson (including a sports coach)be employed as an entertainer (including actors, musicians, dancers etc.)be self-employed or engage in business activityfill a full-time, permanent vacancy (except on a recognised foundation programme or as a students\u2019 union sabbatical officer). If you\u2019re unsure about any of these definitions, please contact us\u00a0and we can advise in more detail. Working for an employer based abroad Whenever you\u2019re physically in the UK and working, whether it\u2019s for an employer in the UK or an employer abroad, all the hours you work count towards your weekly 10- or 20-hour limit. This also includes any remote work you do - for example, a virtual internship. Remote work is not given an exception from the working hours limit, whether it\u2019s for a country based within or outside of the UK. However, if you\u2019re physically outside of the UK, your Student visa work conditions don\u2019t count. You need to check your work rights in the specific country where you\u2019re working. Work placements If you have a Student visa, you\u2019re allowed to complete a work placement as long as it meets the following conditions: it\u2019s an integral and assessed part of your main course of studyit doesn\u2019t make up more than 50% of your programme of study. An example of this would be if your course includes an industrial placement year and this was stated on your Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS). If you\u2019re enrolled on a course at an overseas university and you\u2019re coming to the UK to do part of your course, you may also complete a work placement as part of your course as long as it doesn\u2019t make up more than 50% of your study in the UK. During your work placement, you\u2019re able to work full-time and be paid as such. The University will still be your Student visa sponsor, so you must stay in contact with your department/faculty and keep your contact details up to date. Volunteering and voluntary work Volunteering You can volunteer while you are studying. Volunteering is different from voluntary work (unpaid employment) and doesn\u2019t count towards your weekly working hours limit. Volunteers will normally help a registered charity or voluntary or public sector organisation. If you\u2019re volunteering with an organisation, you must not: have a contract of employmenttake the place of an employeereceive payment for your contribution, including payment in kind. Voluntary work You\u2019re allowed to do voluntary work in the UK but be aware that voluntary work counts towards your weekly working hours limit. As a voluntary worker, you are usually paid in some form and often have a contract with an employer. If you\u2019re unsure, you should check with the organisation whether what you are doing can be regarded as voluntary work. More information about volunteering while on a Student visa is available on UKCISA's website. I'm an EEA/Swiss national If you\u2019re an EEA or Swiss national who has been granted status under the EU Settlement Scheme, you can work in the UK during and after your studies without any restrictions and you don\u2019t need the permission of UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) to do this. I'm an Irish national Irish nationals have the right to live and work in the UK, under the UK and Ireland\u2019s Common Travel Area arrangements. Irish students don\u2019t need to apply for a Student or Graduate visa. Working on a Student visa after studies Types of work you can't do If your Student/Tier 4 visa remains valid once you\u2019ve completed your course, you can work full-time within the following limits: You can\u2019t fill a full-time, permanent vacancy (other than on a recognised Foundation Programme)You can\u2019t be self-employedYou can\u2019t be employed as a professional sportsperson, coach or entertainerYou can work unlimited hours once you\u2019re considered to have completed your course, but not in a permanent role. Most students are granted four months of 'wrap-up' time after the end of their course. This is usually the course end date as stated in your last CAS and will also usually be the same as your course end date on your student record. Taking a permanent role You can start a full-time permanent role while on a Student visa if one of the following applies to you: If your student visa was issued before 6 April 2022: You might be able to start full-time, permanent work for an employer if you\u2019ve completed your course and you\u2019ve made a Skilled Worker visa application. It\u2019s best to check this with your employer or sponsor.\u00a0In this case, \u2018completed your course\u2019 means the official course end date as per your CAS. If your student visa was issued after 6 April 2022: You might be able to start full-time, permanent work for an employer if you\u2019ve completed your course and you\u2019ve made a Skilled Worker visa application. It\u2019s best to check this with your employer or sponsor.You\u2019ve successfully completed your course\u00a0You\u2019ve made a Graduate route visa application. Successful completion is the date that you receive your official results, not the course completion date. If none of the above apply to you, then you can\u2019t start a full-time permanent role while on a Student visa.

Being away from home for the first time can be a daunting experience as you learn to adjust to a new culture alongside your studies. The impact of moving away from a familiar culture to a new unfamiliar environment is known as \u2018culture shock\u2019. It\u2019s important to know that culture shock is felt amongst many students throughout their studies and is perfectly normal. This article will include guidance and tips on how to alleviate feelings of culture shock. In this article: What can contribute to culture shock? What is the W Curve? How can I deal with culture shock? What can contribute to culture shock? Things that may contribute to culture shock include: Adjusting change in climate Experiencing different types of cuisine Learning different languages Unfamiliar\u00a0social behaviours What is the W Curve? The process of culture shock can be illustrated by a model known as the \u201cW\u201d curve. This may not relate entirely to your experience. Sometimes the process is faster or slower but it can be useful to see the different stages that fellow students may be experiencing. Many people go through different phases of the process of adjustment several times, so parts of the curve in the diagram may repeat themselves. For instance, at significant times such as important family dates or festivals you may feel distressed or lonely, while at other times you feel quite settled. However, many people have reported that this model has reflected something of their experience and they have found it helpful to realise they are not the only ones to have had these feelings. Honeymoon When you first arrive in a new culture, differences are intriguing and you may feel excited, stimulated and curious. At this stage you are still protected by the close memory of your home culture. Distress A little later, differences in the culture may make you feel confused or isolated\u00a0as cultural differences intrude and familiar supports (eg family or friends) are not immediately available. Reintegration Next you may reject the differences you encounter. You may feel angry or frustrated, or hostile to the new culture. At this stage you may be conscious mainly of how much you dislike it compared to home. Don\u2019t worry, as this is quite a healthy reaction. You are reconnecting with what you value about yourself and your own culture. Autonomy Differences and similarities are accepted. You may feel relaxed and more confident as you become more familiar with situations and feel able to cope with new situations based on your growing experience. Independence Differences and similarities are valued and important. You may feel full of potential and able to trust yourself in all kinds of situations. Most situations become enjoyable and you are able to make choices according to your preferences and values. You can see a diagram of the \u2018W\u2019 curve on the\u00a0UK Council for International Student Affairs webpage. How can I manage feelings of culture shock? There are a range of things you can do to minimise the effects of culture shock. These include: Keeping in regular touch with your loved ones Having familiar things around you that have personal meaning, such as photographs souvenirs or ornaments. Finding a local shop or supplier which sells familiar food to you. Eating a healthy diet and taking\u00a0regular exercise.

UK Visas & Immigration (UKVI) has introduced concessions for students who may be impacted by the marking and assessment boycott. If your department has confirmed that your results are going to be delayed, or if you believe you may be affected and you want to explore your options, please contact our Visa & International Student Advice team with the information you have been given and your visa expiry date. The Graduate route visa is for students who successfully complete their degree-level course in the UK to apply for permission to stay in the UK beyond the end of their course. How long will a Graduate visa allow me to stay in the UK? If you are an undergraduate, or a taught postgraduate student, and your visa application is successful, you will be able to stay in the UK for two years to work, or look for work, in any sector, and at any level.\u00a0If you are a PhD or a doctoral-level\u00a0student and your visa application is successful, you will be able to stay in the UK for three years to work, or look for work, in any sector, and at any level.\u00a0The visa is not extendable and does not lead to settlement, although you may later be able to switch into another visa category if you meet the relevant requirements. What are the requirements for applying for a Graduate visa?\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b You must apply in the UK.You can only apply once you have been awarded your degree at King\u2019s.You must also hold a valid\u00a0Student route or Tier 4 visa at the time of your application. The university is required to confirm to UK Visas & Immigration (UKVI) that you have successfully completed your course. The Visa Compliance team will do this within 10 working days of your results being formally ratified at the relevant exam board. You will be notified by email once this confirmation has been sent to UKVI. You can't apply for the Graduate visa until all your final results have been formally ratified. This includes the results for any deferrals or resits. If you're unsure when your results will be formally ratified at an exam board, please contact your department/ faculty. Important to know: You must not apply for your Graduate visa until you've received the confirmation email, or your visa application may be refused.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b If you have re-sits or deferrals which will delay the end of your course beyond the original end date on your CAS this could affect your eligibility for the Graduate route, as you may not be awarded your degree before your current visa date. Please contact the Visa & International Student Advice team to discuss any implications for you in these circumstances. You must receive the award which was stated on the CAS you were issued to apply for your Student/Tier 4 visa. If you've changed your course at any point or your exit award has changed, and you want to check your eligibility for the Graduate Route, please\u00a0contact the Visa & International Student Advice team. If, in the last 12 months before the date of your application, you've been awarded a scholarship or sponsorship by a government or international scholarship agency covering both fees and living costs for study in the UK, you must provide written consent from them with your application. If you travel outside the UK after your course ends, you must return to the UK before your Student/Tier 4 visa expires to remain eligible to apply for the Graduate visa. You cannot apply for a Graduate visa from outside the UK. Meeting the \u2018Study in the UK\u2019 requirement Part of the eligibility criteria for applying for the Graduate visa is that applicants must have completed their degrees whilst studying within the UK. However, there are some exceptions: A period of study abroad: Students who took part in a permitted Study Abroad programme during their studies will still be able to meet the 'Study in the UK' requirement. COVID-19 Concessions:\u00a0The UK Home Office COVID-19 Concessions\u00a0make allowances for students impacted by COVID-19\u00a0to still be eligible under the Graduate route in the following circumstances: Students on programmes of 12 months or less If you started your studies in 2020 or 2021 and you studied entirely remotely because of COVID-19, for the whole of your course without travelling to the UK, the deadline for coming to the UK under the Student route has now passed. It was either 27 September 2021, or the end date of your visa if your visa ended before 27 September 2021.If you started\u00a0your studies in 2020 or 2021 and studied\u00a0remotely because of COVID-19, but have a current visa for studies and previously entered the UK, then you need to enter the UK before the end date of your current Student/Tier 4 visa.If you started a course of 12 months or less in Autumn 2021 or Spring 2022 via remote learning from outside the UK, while\u00a0holding a Student visa,\u00a0you must have entered the UK no later than 30 June 2022 and complete that course of study in the UK whilst holding a Student visa, to be eligible for the Graduate route. Students on programmes of more than 12 months (including 1 year Master's) Students sponsored for a course lasting longer than 12 months will not be prevented from being eligible for the Graduate route as a result of any remote learning that took place either in the UK or outside the UK between the period of 24 January 2020 and 27 September 2021, or any remote learning which already took place or will take place outside the UK between 27 September 2021 and 30 June 2022\u00a0whilst holding a Student visa.If your current Student visa/Tier 4\u00a0expired\u00a0prior to 30 June 2022, you must have entered the UK before the expiry of your student permission rather than 30 June 2022. Can my dependants apply under the Graduate route? Individuals who already have permission as a dependant of a student who is applying on this route can also apply to extend their permission as a dependant. However, new dependants are not permitted on this route.

Many international students are visited by their family or friends from home while they are in the UK.\u00a0The normal visa that\u00a0people would use for this\u00a0is the Standard Visitor visa, commonly called a tourist visa. Depending on where your visitors\u00a0come\u00a0from, they might\u00a0be able to\u00a0obtain\u00a0this\u00a0visa on entry to the UK at immigration rather than applying\u00a0for it\u00a0in advance. They\u00a0can\u00a0use the\u00a0UKVI checking service\u00a0to see if they need to apply for a visa in advance. If your family/friends\u00a0are able to obtain entry to the UK at the airport without applying for a visa in advance, they should still ensure they have documentation with them in their hand luggage to show the immigration officer (guidance on this is provided via the UKVI checking service).

Your visitors should read the government's immigration guidance carefully before applying for a visa. There is no specific list of documents they must show to get this visa, nor is there a specific amount of money that you or they must hold. Your visitor will need to demonstrate to UKVI that they: want to visit the UK for 6 months or lessintend to leave the UK at the end of their visithave enough money to support themselves during their visitdo not intend to work in the UK UKVI are also likely to require evidence that your visitors have somewhere to stay during their time in the UK and will want to see evidence of their reason for visiting, so will need additional evidence from you (see below). Your visitors should check with their local UK embassy if there are any further documents they need before they apply. Important to know: Visitors are not eligible for NHS health treatment. Your visitors should arrange their own travel/health insurance and have evidence of this when they make their application.If your visitors are non-visa nationals and intend to obtain entry to the UK on arrival at the airport, they should still carry documentation that demonstrates all of the above with them in their hand luggage in case the immigration officer asks to see this evidence. 5 Documents you can provide to assist with the Standard Visitor visa application process: You can write an invitation letter for your visitors and post this to your family or friends to submit in support of their visa application. Each person you invite will need their own original letter from you. We suggest your invitation letter to include below information: who you are inviting over (the relationship between you and the person)your current status (e.g. full-time student studying on BSc/BA/MSc/MA programme at King's)the reason they are visiting you (e.g. attending your graduation ceremony, travelling with you, or any other specific reasons)the proposed length of stay in the UKthe accommodation arrangement made for the person during the timelist of documents you will provide to support their visitor visa applicationIf you're financially supporting your visitor, you will need to send an original bank statement to demonstrate that you have enough funds to do this.If your visitor is staying with you then you will need to state this in your invitation letter. If they are staying in a hotel then you can submit a hotel booking, or they can book their own hotel and show evidence of their booking.You will always need to send your visitors copies of your passport details page, visa page and Biometric Residence Permit (if you have one) for them to enclose in support of their Standard Visitor visa application.You will also always need to send a letter from the University confirming you are a student.

Any changes to your programme of study can impact your Student visa.\u00a0You might need more time because of one of the following reasons: you\u2019re repeating all or some of an academic yearyou\u2019ve deferred all or some of your assessments to a later dateyou\u2019re completing a reassessmentyou need to complete your postgraduate research studies. You can only be sponsored for a Student visa if there\u2019s a requirement for you to attend in-person teaching, supervision or assessments. If your visa is due to expire and you still have further study to complete, our Visa Compliance team will assess if this further study meets the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI)\u2019s rules for further Student visa sponsorship. Alongside the attendance requirements, they\u2019ll also review whether you can complete any additional study within your current visa expiry and if there will be any gaps between your periods of study where you may be considered a dormant student and therefore not be eligible for visa sponsorship. In some cases, you might be eligible to further visa sponsorship, but you\u2019ll be required to leave the UK and make your visa application from your home country. Important to know:\u00a0if you\u2019ve completed all aspects of your programme of study but you wish to stay in the UK to receive your results, this wouldn\u2019t qualify you for further visa sponsorship. Unfortunately, you\u2019ll need to leave the UK before your current visa expires and wait for your results online.

Visa re-registration is a process specifically designed for certain students who need to validate their immigration status when the university doesn't have evidence of their current or expired visa. This process is essential for continuing students based in the UK and subject to immigration control. For students in this category, the visa verification process ensures that we maintain updated visa documentation, verifying your ongoing right to study. If you fall into this category, we'll send you an invitation during term-time to submit your visa documents through Student Records. This verification process is crucial for the university to fulfil its obligations as a licensed sponsor under the student visa route, ensuring compliance with UK Visas & Immigration (UKVI) requirements. What documents do I need for visa re-registration? If you\u2019re a student affected, the documents needed will be included in an email sent to you from our Visa Compliance Service. Usually, this includes your passport, visa and any other immigration-related documents. If you have a digital status, you\u2019ll need to provide your .Gov Share Code so we can verify your immigration status.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b What happens if I don't take part in visa re-registration?

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-02090 Print My Biometric Residence Permit (BRP) is expiring on 31 December 2024 Biometric Residence Permits (BRPs) are being phased out by UK Visa and Immigration (UKVI) and replaced by a digital immigration status known as the eVisa. If you have a BRP that expires on 31 December 2024, you\u2019ll soon transition from physical documents to the eVisa system. This change means that visa holders will need to register an account with UKVI. This account will provide access to important information such as your immigration status, attached conditions and expiry dates. This will replace the need for a physical BRP or visa documents. What do I need to do? At first, UKVI will contact a limited number of visa holders (around 30,000 student visa holders) by email to take part in a trial run of the new system. Therefore, the option to create a UKVI account is currently available by invitation only. If you haven't been invited yet, you can\u2019t create an account. However, you can prepare in advance by signing up for updates from UKVI about these changes and reading about what it means for you. When will I be contacted by UKVI? If you haven't heard or received anything from UKVI, there's no need to worry - the transition from BRPs to eVisas for current holders is expected to take several months. As it's a phased process, others may receive invitations to register their accounts before you. This isn't cause for concern; UKVI will contact you in due course to register your new account. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t provide a specific timeframe for when you might hear from UKVI. I have a visa that isn't a Student visa. How will this impact me? If you hold another visa type, please refer to UKVI\u2019s website to see how the changes may impact you. How can King's support me? This article will be updated as information is released by UKVI. If you have any questions or concerns about the length of your visa, or how any changes to your study might impact your visa, please contact the Visa & International Student Advice team.

They have vast academic experience and receive training to understand the variety of support options available at King\u2019s, so they will be an invaluable source of guidance as you journey through your degree. What if I am a Study Abroad student at King\u2019s? Your Study Abroad tutor is an academic member of staff with your department who provides guidance and support to study abroad students at King\u2019s. Each department has an academic member of staff appointed to the role of Study Abroad Tutor; you can find a full list of the departmental study abroad tutors\u00a0at Study Abroad tutors.

When should I approach the Senior Tutor, instead of my personal tutor? There may be times when you\u2019d prefer to approach someone other than your personal tutor with an issue. Such situations may include: If your personal tutor is unavailable or unresponsiveIf you don\u2019t feel comfortable discussing a matter with your personal tutorIf you have a reason to request to change your personal tutor King\u2019s works to support underrepresented learners and their supporters, empowering them to access, thrive and succeed in higher education. This is the King's Social Mobility & Widening Participation mission, and the Senior Tutors form a part of this. Senior Tutors are often assigned to students from underrepresented groups and may have more of an understanding of the barriers they face studying at university. In particular if you are a care leaver or care experienced student, estranged from parents or care givers, in receipt of the Sanctuary Scholarship, or are under 18 years old, you may be assigned to your Senior Tutor or another experienced personal tutor in your department. If you would like to approach someone other than the Senior Tutor with an issue, you can contact your Faculty Wellbeing Advisor.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b \u200b Will I have the same personal tutor throughout my time at King's? In most cases your personal tutor will support you from induction through to graduation. In some cases, however, it will be necessary for you to be allocated a new personal tutor. This could be because your personal tutor goes on a period of sabbatical or other leave, because they move to a new role, or because they retire. If your personal tutor does change, your new personal tutor will make every effort to get to know you as soon as possible \u2013 and you are encouraged to be proactive in getting to know them, too.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Do postgraduate research students have a personal tutor?

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01333 Print What do I talk about with my personal tutor? What topics will we discuss & how does this relationship work? When you meet with your personal tutor, conversation should\u00a0focus around your academic progress and goals, any difficulties\u00a0that you might be experiencing and how they are affecting your studies. You might also talk about your results and your feedback across your course.Your personal tutor can help you to identify opportunities that you may be interested in pursuing outside of your studies to support your development and future plans - from\u00a0internships\u00a0and\u00a0research\u00a0opportunities, to\u00a0studying\u00a0abroad,\u00a0joining a\u00a0KCLSU\u00a0society and engaging in our range of\u00a0extra-curricular activities.Your personal tutor can also support you if changes arise in your personal circumstances, by offering you the chance to discuss how these\u00a0might\u00a0impact your studies and directing you towards further specialist support at the university.Our advice is to get to know your personal tutor; this relationship works best for you if you maintain good communications with each other; as with any good relationship, it requires effort from both sides. Having a good relationship is important, especially as you may wish for your personal tutor to\u00a0write you a reference\u00a0for a future course or job. What academic support can I get from my personal tutor? General academic progress Your personal tutor will organise time to meet with you to discuss your academic progress in general.\u00a0They are not able to work one-to-one with you to prepare specific pieces of academic work,\u00a0but if you are struggling to complete work independently or experiencing other academic difficulties, then\u00a0you should still speak to your personal tutor.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Understanding feedback Your personal tutor can help you understand feedback that you have received from across your modules, or they might provide general guidance on academic practice in their discipline, but they cannot give you feedback on individual pieces of work. You can\u00a0discuss feedback\u00a0you have received from assessments with your personal tutor,\u00a0identifying\u00a0any key areas for improvement and where you are excelling. However, you should discuss any queries about specific feedback or pieces of work with the relevant module leader.\u00a0Your personal tutor will encourage you to seek further specialist support with academic skills, if you need it.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Broad knowledge Your personal tutor will not always be an expert in all areas you are studying, but they will be committed to your academic progress and development more generally. If your personal tutor does not have expertise in a particular area of your studies, they will direct you to other staff within the department.Use your meetings with your personal tutor to reflect on your\u00a0progress\u00a0across your degree programme; what new\u00a0skills\u00a0have you developed and how do these support your\u00a0employability? Consider and discuss whether there are areas you are finding difficult and what\u00a0support\u00a0is available. What other resources are there for academic support? King's Academic Skills for Learning (KASL):\u00a0A range of resources and activities to help students succeed in their studies, covering topics such as maths & statistics, writing, presentations, as well as finding and evaluating information. As part of this you can book online or in-person 1:1 sessions with PhD Academic Skills tutors, who can provide advice with regards to academic writing or feedback on course assignments Teaching, Learning & Assessment with Technology: Guidance on building online communities, engaging with remote lectures and preparing for online assessments. Do personal tutors provide welfare & wellbeing support? Personal challenges which may affect your studies could be wide-ranging; these could be academic, financial, health-related or another type of issue. We recommend discussing such challenges with your personal tutor \u2013 they will listen and if they can\u2019t help you themselves, they will know who to\u00a0refer\u00a0you to.Even if a personal challenge isn\u2019t affecting your studies, keeping your personal tutor in-the-know could be useful if these challenges start to impact your studies later.Important to know: The personal tutor role does not require professional training for mental health support. Instead, personal tutors are trained to refer students effectively to appropriate support and teams within Student Services.\u00a0These teams have staff specifically trained in\u00a0mental health support and other welfare support areas. We expect your personal tutor to\u00a0be able to direct you to these teams when required and crucially, be available to discuss\u00a0how any difficulties might impact\u00a0your studies.While personal tutors are not required to have professional qualifications in supporting mental health, they (like all staff) are invited to attend various information courses. See\u00a0Raising awareness about mental health. Mental health & wellbeing support If you are experiencing challenges with your wellbeing, in addition to seeking support from your personal tutor for how this may impact your studies, we also strongly encourage you to look up articles in our Health & Wellbeing category for further information and guidance. In particular, our\u00a0Top tips on managing your mental health & wellbeing\u00a0is a great starting point if you're unsure about what support options are available. How much personal information should I share with my personal tutor? If you are having personal difficulties that are likely to affect your studies, then you are strongly encouraged to discuss these with your personal tutor. How much you choose to tell them is up to you. Your personal tutor will treat these discussions as confidential unless they feel that there is a risk to you or others, or if they need to share information with another service to access further support for you.Important to know: Consider discussing difficulties that are affecting your studies if you have an assessment coming up, so that you understand how to apply for mitigating circumstances, if necessary. Further guidance can also be found in our article What are mitigating circumstances? I\u2019m disabled - does my personal tutor need to know? If you require adjustments to support your learning, or your disability or disabilities are having an impact on your studies, then you are encouraged to seek specialist support at the university through the Disability Support Team. We also encourage you to consider sharing this information with your personal tutor so they are aware of your needs within the department. If you have a King\u2019s Inclusion Plan (KIP), this should be shared with your personal tutor to help them support your study needs. Will my personal tutor keep what I tell them confidential? Your personal tutor will treat your conversations as confidential unless they feel that there is a risk to you or others, or if they need to share information with another service to access further support for you. How should I prepare for meeting with my personal tutor?\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Your personal tutor meetings provide a great opportunity to reflect on your achievement & challenges of the term or year so far, and set goals for what you would like to achieve next, while you are studying at King\u2019s, so it can be helpful to think about these things in advance.The Starting your Studies at King\u2019s\u00a0article and accompanying Reflection Tool are very useful for helping you to think about the academic skills you already have and what you would like to develop. You can take the Reflection Tool along with you to personal tutor meetings as a talking point, or share it with your personal tutor in advance of your meeting.You may also want to engage with the Careers & Employability resources to help you understand what stage of future planning you are at, so you can discuss your next steps with your personal tutor.Important to know: If you are invited to a group personal tutor meeting you can request a 1-2-1 meeting as well or instead; for example if there is something that you don\u2019t feel comfortable talking about in front of your peers. You can also request additional meetings with your personal tutor outside of the ones that they schedule with you. Remember to you let your personal tutor know if you cannot attend a meeting that has been arranged, and try to give them as much notice as possible. It is helpfully to suggest some convenient times for the meeting to be arranged as well. Tips for talking to academic staff If you feel unsure about approaching academic staff at networking events, or asking them a question about your course, this guidance provided by an Undergraduate English student may be helpful. How should I approach/begin this conversation? You are likely to already have a common interest: your chosen field of study. They may be an expert in something you\u2019ve only just started to learn, but you both chose to invest in the same area of academia. If you\u2019re in first year, maybe ask which modules they teach, and what these modules involve.If you are initially nervous about diving straight into a personal topic, perhaps begin with easy chat about the course.If you are taking their module, you can ask about what to expect and how you can prepare, if not you can ask them more about their area of research or teaching. How personal should I be? When it comes to bridging the gap between professional and amicable, feel free to take your tutor\u2019s lead. It\u2019s probably best to stay fairly polite and formal to start with, but it\u2019s likely things will become more casual as you get to know each other. Your tutor may share some details about their personal life with you (e.g. what they did at the weekend) and you are welcome to share in return if you feel comfortable. Can I ask my personal tutor for an academic reference? You may want your personal tutor to\u00a0provide\u00a0a reference\u00a0for you when applying for jobs or further study.\u00a0For\u00a0your personal tutor to be able to do this,\u00a0it is important that you have met them regularly\u00a0and\u00a0kept them up to date with your achievements.You should give your personal tutor plenty of notice if you are requesting a reference, as these can take some time to complete, and you should also let them know in advance that you are including them as a reference in your application(s). When requesting a reference, it is helpful to share your CV, the job description and any other application criteria with your personal tutor.Please refer to our more detailed guidance on this topic in our article How can I get an academic/personal reference?

I\u2019m an undergraduate student; how often should I meet my personal tutor? As an undergraduate student, we encourage both you and your personal tutor to meet at least 4 times\u00a0in your first year, and then twice per year in your subsequent years. You can of course request more meetings than this if you have more you wish to discuss, or something has changed between scheduled meetings. Don\u2019t feel you have to wait until the next scheduled meeting for support. I\u2019m a postgraduate taught student; how often should I meet my personal tutor? As a postgraduate taught student,\u00a0we recommend that you meet your personal tutor twice a year. You can of course request more meetings than this if you have more you wish to discuss, or something has changed between scheduled meetings. Don\u2019t feel you have to wait until the next scheduled meeting for support. Is personal tutoring different for postgraduate taught students compared with undergraduates? The personal tutor role is the same, but because\u00a0many postgraduates are only studying for a year the schedule of meetings will be different, and you might\u00a0find that you also build a supportive relationship with your programme director or your dissertation\u00a0supervisor. How and when do I arrange my meetings? Within the first few weeks of starting at King\u2019s you should meet with your personal tutor. This may\u00a0be in a small group or one-to-one. Your personal tutor will contact you to arrange your first meeting. During your first meeting you should discuss when and how future meetings will be arranged. Important to know: If your personal tutor invites you to a group meeting but there are things that you would like to discuss with them more privately you are very welcome to request an additional or alternative one-to-one meeting. You can also contact your personal tutor outside\u00a0set meetings should a question or issue arise. Keeping in touch with your personal tutor will help you get to know each other better,\u00a0which will be particularly useful if you ask them to write a reference for you. At your\u00a0initial\u00a0meeting they will tell you about the role of the personal tutor and give you information about how you can get in touch. Contacting your personal tutor Contacting your personal tutor by email from your KCL account is the best and most appropriate method of contacting your tutor and setting up meetings. If you\u2019re unsure about how to approach them or concerned about the level of formality to use, follow our quick guide, as provided by an Undergraduate English student: Step 1: Greeting This does not need to be overly formal so you can avoid \"Dear Sir or Madam\". The best bet is to use \"Dear/Hi [Tutor Name]\", and if you haven\u2019t met them before it is polite to use \"Dr/Professor\" followed by their last name Step 2: Main Message Write this as you would any other email. You don't need to use fancy or 'academic' language, just say what you mean so you can both understand what you're asking. Keep the message polite and friendly and you're on the right track. Step 3: Goodbye You don't need to use \u201cYours Sincerely\u201d or learn its distinction with \u201cYours Faithfully\u201d you can use a stock phrase that's polite but not too formal. For example: \u201cMany Thanks\u201d, \u201cBest\u201d, \u201cAll the Best\u201d, \u201cCheers\u201d or \u201cKind Regards\u201d. It will help to add an email signature to your new King's Outlook email with your name, course and year and your student number. Will my meetings be one-to-one or in a group? Your personal tutor might offer a mixture of one-to-one and group meetings, or they may have a preference for one type of meeting. Group meetings offer a great opportunity for you to meet other students from within your department/faculty, some of who may be from other year groups. Sharing your experiences and achievements, as well as how you have overcome any challenges, can help you to learn new things about yourself and your peers. You may also hear about a society, activity, job opportunity or support service you weren't aware of before! If your personal tutor invites you to a group meeting but there are things that you would like to discuss with them more privately you are very welcome to request an additional or alternative one-to-one meeting. What if I can\u2019t attend a meeting that\u2019s been arranged? If you can't attend a meeting, contact your personal tutor\u00a0to arrange a more suitable time, or if you\u2019re running late, please let them know as soon as possible. This is a good opportunity to develop professional skills such as time management and good email practice; important skills you will need in your career. Regular communication with any tutor is a good practice to have, and this will help tutors and other staff members keep track of how you\u2019re doing and support your ongoing wellbeing. I\u2019m doing fine and happy with everything. Should I still arrange to see my personal tutor? Yes. Personal tutor meetings are good opportunities to reflect on your progress generally, including all of your successes. They can also be helpful for identifying other opportunities that you might want to take up alongside your studies so that you get the most out of your time at King's. Meeting with your personal tutor can also be useful for keeping them informed of your progress - in and outside of King's. This can be helpful if you\u2019d like them to provide a reference for you at some point in the future. It is also important to build a relationship with your personal tutor so that you feel comfortable with them, should any difficulties arise later on. I haven't heard from my personal tutor. What should I do? If you have not heard from your personal tutor, or you have tried to contact them they haven't responded or are unavailable, then you should contact your\u00a0Senior Tutor. To find out more about the role of the Senior Tutor, please check out our article Who is my personal tutor & what do they do? Will personal tutor meetings be held in-person or online? Personal tutor meetings in this academic year will be available both online and in-person; the format you are offered may depend on the availability of both you and your personal tutor. If there is something that you would specifically like to speak to your personal tutor about in-person you can request this, and they will do their best to accommodate it themselves or with another trusted member of the department (e.g. your Senior Tutor) if they are unable to. Online meetings will take place using Microsoft Teams. These may be group or one-to-one meetings. Where you are invited to a group meeting you are welcome to also request a one-to-one meeting with your personal tutor. \u200b\u200b\u200b Related Articles (2) What do I talk about with my personal tutor?

Studying in London is a unique experience compared to other universities. Whilst the capital offers an unrivalled amount of things to see and do, it can at first be challenge. Although there are a few discount options available to help reduce costs, understanding which one is best and most suitable can in itself be a confusing process. Most students are aware of the 18+ Student Oyster Photocard, but there are also other, lesser known discount railcards. So, which one is the best? The simple answer is that it depends entirely on you - how frequently you use the transport network, and during which times. Important to know:\u00a0If you\u2019re travelling on public transport in London, check the\u00a0Transport for London (TfL) to see which services are running, plus you can sign up for email updates from TfL. What is the 18+ Student Oyster card and how can I get one? The 18+ Oyster entitles you to 30% off travelcards and Bus and Tram season tickets. It is available to full-time King\u2019s students living in the Greater London area, and you\u00a0apply\u00a0online using the TfL website at a cost of \u00a320. You\u2019ll simply need your course dates, the student number on your ID card, as well as a photo and your email.Applying a discounted travelcard to an Oyster gives peace of mind that you won\u2019t spend any more than the amount you\u2019ve already paid. However, bear in mind there is no discount to pay-as-you-go fares with an 18+ Oyster. You could be overpaying for a travelcard if you aren\u2019t using the tube or buses frequently, so it is worth considering the other option before handing over \u00a320 to TfL.We recommend reading the detail of what the benefits are, as well as the eligibility criteria for this travel card at TfL 18+ Student Oyster photocard.If you are eligible and wish to apply, please refer to our specific guidance when applying as a King\u2019s student in the guidance below.Important to know: If you take a break from your studies, you won\u2019t be eligible for the 18+ Oyster card for the duration of your interruption.

This is the 7 or 8 digit number on your student card.\u00a0Please do not enter the ID that begins with a \u201cK\u201d as this may cause delays in approving your application. Important to know: Most part-time students and\u00a0students on a break/interruption of study are\u00a0not eligible\u00a0for the 18+ Student Oyster photocard. Please refer to the more detailed guidance at\u00a0TfL 18+ Student Oyster and to our guidance on interruptions for undergraduate students or postgraduate taught students.The King's Student Funding Office confirms whether applicants are registered as full-time for TfL.Applications\u00a0cannot be approved until the first day of term, so the Student Funding Office will begin approving application from then onwards.

Anyone under 31 is covered by either one of the railcards without needing any further approval \u2013 you can apply directly through the website.The main difference comes if you are studying and over 30; for this you\u2019re best to refer to details for the 16-25 railcard. Comparing the 18+ Student Oyster card and 16-25 Railcard: which student travel card is right for me? If you are not using public transport frequently but instead walking or cycling to university and only using the tube occasionally, the 18+ Oyster may not be worthwhile. To check fares for travel across the different zones using the various payment methods, refer to TfL 18+ Student fares.Unless you travel very regularly on pay-as-you-go fares, a 16-25 Railcard may be more appropriate to save money on off-peak fares, when using the tube or city trains to see friends or explore London for leisure. Even if you use the tube frequently on one day, fares automatically cap at the zone rate, ensuring you can\u2019t spend any more than this in one day. Caps can increase year on year, so if you think you might stick to standard pay-as-you-go, we recommend checking TfL\u2019s Pay as you go caps.The 16-25 railcard offers an additional \u2153 off daily caps when using the tube off-peak bringing the cap down further. On the other hand, if you are regularly using transport to travel into university and at peak times, the discounted travelcard allows for unlimited journeys on a weekly or monthly basis, and so may make the 18+ Oyster better value. If you do opt for the 18+ Oyster, you can still apply a 16-25 railcard discount allowing for the best of both worlds. You can opt for a discounted travelcard in the weeks you use public transport frequently whilst allowing for a pay-as-you-go discount when not using transport frequently outside of term time. If you are living in Zone 2, you may opt for a Zone 1-2 weekly travelcard to get to university, but use the 16-25 Railcard when you make journeys to Zone 3 and beyond to explore areas outside of Central London. A combination of the two allows for maximum flexibility. In the end, it depends entirely on your personal use. It\u2019s a good idea to check how much you are using public transport to see if the total regularly exceeds or is below the cost of a travelcard for your zone.To work out what you\u2019re spending your money on to help you budget better, refer to our guide on managing your money. Additional support for students with disabilities I\u2019m a disabled student living in London, can I apply for a freedom pass? If you live in a London borough and meet the eligibility criteria, you may be able to apply for a Disabled Persons Freedom Pass, which can provide free access to public transport across the Transport for London network. For further guidance on how to submit an application, visit the London Councils webpage\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. Working out what you need step-by-step Step 1: Make sure you're\u00a0using either an Oyster or Contactless Card Paper ticket fares are incredibly expensive in London, and nowadays often unnecessary when so many credit and debit cards have the contactless feature.You will know if your debit card is contactless depending on whether it has the contactless symbol. Though contactless removes the need to top-up, discounts cannot be applied and it can be more difficult to keep track of spending. Adult Oyster cards are available at ticket machines at any Tube station for a \u00a35. Even if you opt to apply for an 18+ Oyster, it is worth paying this while you wait for your 18+ Oyster, because it can sometimes take a couple of weeks for the university to approve this for you. Step 2: How much are you using transport and when? To keep track of usage, make sure to register your Oyster Card online following the instructions on the TfL website. Once you have done this, you can view journey history and see daily expenditure. You may wish to set up a Contactless and Oyster account which also has a matching app, which allows you to check your journey history, easily top-up credit and you\u2019ll get notifications when your credit runs low.Keeping track of your journeys and your spending means you can total the weekly and estimate the monthly and annual costs, and compare this with the cost of discounted travelcards for each zone. For details on fares across a range of transport types in the capital visit TfL Find fares. Step 3: Apply for the discount cards If you find you are exceeding the cost of a travelcard via pay-as-you-go fares it is likely that an 18+ Oyster is a sound investment and can be applied for online. Please refer to our guidance in How do I apply for an 18+ Student Oyster photocard?If you are only occasionally using public transport and therefore coming in below the cost of a travelcard, or simply want both discounts and the option of discounts on trains throughout the UK, you can apply for the 16-25 Railcard online. Important to know: Buses are almost always cheaper than the tube and the Hopper Fare gives you unlimited journeys, made within 1 hour of touching in.Remember to tap in and tap out at all stations even if there are no barriers. Forgetting to tap both in and out on the tube will lead to a penalty fare. King\u2019s Student Funding Office confirm student attendance to TfL for applications to be approved. September and October are very busy periods as many students apply for the 18+ Oyster card, so bear in mind you may need to wait; please allow at least 3 weeks for processing. How can I travel around London on a budget? If you\u2019d like to minimise your travel on public transport and want an alternative cheap mode of transport, you could try\u00a0Santander Cycles.\u00a0This is an easy bike hire system with no need to book in advance. You can simply hire a cycle by going to your nearest docking station terminal with a debit or credit card. Be sure to take your card with you;\u00a0while contactless cards are accepted, but contactless devices including phones and smartwatches, are not. You can also\u00a0download the free Santander Cycles app\u00a0and pay for the hire using the app instead. For up to 30 minutes, you can ride an unlimited journey for just \u00a32. Every additional 30 minutes will be charged at \u00a32. Remember to return your cycle within 24 hours to your nearest docking station terminal. Otherwise, you may be charged.

How you can\u00a0personally contribute to safer public spacesAll of us can play our part in making public spaces and streets safer. When you are out after dark, or the streets around you are quiet, please consider the following: Keep your distance. For example, rather than coming up behind someone, consider crossing the road. Someone walking ahead of you may perceive you to be a threat, even if that\u2019s not what you intend.If you can\u2019t cross the road, avoid coming up behind someone quickly or quietly. For example, call out \u2018runner passing on your right\u2019; make a phone call, or pretend to make one, to a family member or friend. Silence can be scary.Give other people space \u2013 if you\u2019re passing someone else on a footpath or pavement, give as much space as possible to avoid crowding them, and move into single file if you\u2019re walking with someone else.Avoid making eye contact/staring, or making personal comments to or about someone you don\u2019t know. Be an Active Bystander \u2013If you see someone on their own who appears to be in distress, don\u2019t ignore it \u2013 if safe to do so and without putting yourself in any danger, ask the person if they need any help or call the police on 999 telling them where you are and what you can see.If you sense someone is in a situation that\u2019s making them uncomfortable, it can be more helpful to speak to the other party, rather than to the person who\u2019s on the receiving end of their unwanted attention, as long as it is safe to do so. For example, asking for directions or the time can help defuse a difficult situation.If you\u2019re on campus alert the KCL security teams on 020 7848 8661 ext. 88661Don\u2019t be put off approaching someone who may need assistance, but think about how best to communicate reassurance rather than increase their concerns.Sign up to the UN Women UK\u2019s campaign for safe public spaces to learn more. Their research shows that over 70% of women in the UK have experienced sexual harassment in public, and all of us can contribute to ensuring that public spaces are safer.

Share and be fair: Please vacate your space for long breaks. If you are not using a PC, please leave that space free for others to use. (Belongings left unattended for longer than 30 minutes may be moved by staff if necessary to make space for others to study.) Pick up your valuables: Never to leave your valuables unattended, even for the shortest time as thefts can occur. Echo the silence: Please allow those who wish to study in silence in the Silent Zones the opportunity to do so. Care for the books: Please remember that library books are a shared resource and refrain from writing or highlighting in them. Talk quietly: Keep your voice low and conversations to a minimum, be aware of the noise you are making when leaving a Discussion zone (e.g. Group Study Room) into a Quiet zone (most areas within the libraries). I'm trying to study quietly and others around me are being noisy and disruptive; what can I do? You can Text the Noise Line on 07883303052, describing your location (library name and room) and they will respond as soon as they are able to.

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-01985 Print What is code of conduct for booking rooms? King's has determined that suitable space is available for students to book on an ad-hoc basis for private and group study. Rooms are available 24 hours in advance and can be booked between 9.00-18.00 via Resource Booker. Details on how to book a room are available on the article Where can I study on campus? Important to know:\u00a0The rooms are part of the central teaching space and may be booked for teaching and meetings. Bookings for societies and social events must follow the KCLSU room booking process and code of conduct. Code of conduct All members of the King\u2019s community are expected to treat each other with respect and comply with the King\u2019s Community Charter. The code of conduct should be read in conjunction with the Charter. The general rules for room booking are: The person making the booking is responsible for sharing this code of conduct with other students who are using the space with them. Each student is expected to be respectful of the space and those using it, and to meet the standards expected of all members of the King\u2019s community. The person making the booking should ensure that the booked room is used or cancelled if the room is no longer required. Failure to do so may result in you being unable to make future bookings. Registered students must present a valid student ID card or be issued a visitor's pass by security to access the building. Students must carry their student ID card or visitor\u2019s pass whenever they are on campus and It must be presented whenever it is requested by a staff member (including security staff). Where the photograph is not clear, additional confirmation of identity may be required. If a building closes at short notice due to emergency or staffing issues, you will have to make alternative arrangements for your booking. To help maintain a safe, clean and tidy environment conducive to study, we ask that you: Do not bring hot or smelly foods or alcohol into centrally bookable spacesLeave the room promptly at the end of your booked sessionDo not distribute or place any flyers, handbills, newspapers or literature within the centrally bookable spaces\u00a0Ensure you reset the standard furniture layout afterwards so subsequent sessions are not disruptedTake responsibility for all your belongings whilst in our spaces. We are not able to accept responsibility for any loss of items left unattended in any roomDo not leave anything of value unattended. Security staff may remove items left after the end of the booking. Breach of the code of conduct If your conduct falls below the expected standards of behaviour, this will be regarded as a breach of the\u00a0room booking code of conduct. As a result, you can be asked to leave the room, and the matter can also be escalated to Student Conduct & Appeals in line with King's Non-Academic Misconduct Policy & Procedure. Unacceptable behaviour includes, but is not limited to, those outlined in the Non-Academic Misconduct Guidance. Examples of unacceptable behaviour which may be considered misconduct are: Offensive or abusive behaviour, such as the use of inappropriate languageDamage to property, such as damaging equipment in the space or the space itselfUnauthorised taking or use of property such as taking or misuse of computer equipment or misuse of the space.Causing a health and safety concern such as failure to follow fire safety procedures. This could include disabling fire extinguishers or other fire safety equipment or smoking in the space.Operational obstruction such as interfering with the activities of King\u2019s or interfering with the activities or duties of staff or other students. This could include disrupting or disturbing others in the use of the space or using the space inappropriately.Any activities which may or do damage the reputation of King\u2019s Keywords: resource booker Related Articles (3) How can I respect others while using shared spaces in libraries?

We also support, promote and safeguard academic freedom and freedom of speech and expression within the law. The right to protest must be balanced between the rights of protesters to state their views and the rights of students, staff and visitors to work and study, without hindrance and free from intimidation and harassment. We support our students and staff to exercise their right to take part in protests and demonstrations and expect them to do so peacefully and with consideration for others. You can make your voice heard within the law: \u2718 Do not use words, phrases or images that incite racism or hatred of others. \u2718 Do not threaten or harass. \u2718 Do not support proscribed organisations. \u2718 Do not damage or trespass on property. Please be aware that some spaces are managed by the University, but others are public spaces, such as the pedestrianised Strand, which comes under the authority of the Metropolitan Police and is outside the University\u2019s control. Think before you act: \u2714 Express your views, opinions and differences with civility. \u2714 Consider the impact your actions may have on others. \u2714 Cooperate with reasonable requests from the University\u2019s Security or Duty Dean. \u2714 Allow others the freedom to assemble and express opinions or beliefs different to your own. \u2718\u00a0Do not disrupt people\u2019s work or study. \u2718 Do not use loudhailers, loudspeakers and other noise-making devices on University campuses. \u2718 Do not disrupt University events. \u2718 Do not obstruct paths, roads, campus entrances and exits or prevent students, staff or visitors from entering our campuses or buildings. Arranging and promoting protests or demonstrations: \u2714 Protests can be conducted in relation to a planned event but must not inhibit or disrupt the event from taking place or continuing to its planned conclusion. \u2714 Demonstrations, protests and events and external speakers must be risk-assessed in line with the standard University practice. \u2714 Send appropriate communications by permitted means, including use of media and social media to explain messages or campaigns. \u2714 Communications must not be rude, threatening or disrespectful. The University\u2019s responsibilities are to: \u2714 Provide a safe environment where students and staff can meet to speak and act freely, within the law. \u2714 Manage where protests or demonstrations take place on our campuses to ensure safety and safeguard freedom of speech. \u2714 Challenge any behaviours that are not in keeping with the University\u2019s regulations, policies and Community Charter. \u2714 Ask protesters on campus who are not King\u2019s staff or students to leave, if prior arrangements have not been made through the event booking process. \u2714 Liaise with the relevant authorities if required. Tell the University about inappropriate behaviour: Racism,\u00a0anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, abuse, incitement and harassment are totally unacceptable and have no place at King\u2019s. We take reports seriously and encourage students, staff and visitors to report any incidents targeted at them or that they witness through our online tool, Report + Support.

If you\u2019re going to be away on or before an election, you may decide a proxy vote is a better option for you. The deadline to apply for a postal vote to vote in the 2024 general election was 17.00 on Wednesday 19 June (or 17.00 on Friday 14 June in Northern Ireland). Your postal vote must reach your local authority by 22.00 on 4 July. The deadline to apply for a proxy vote was 17.00 on Wednesday 26 June (or 17.00 on Friday 14 June in Northern Ireland). Voting as a student As a student, you\u2019ll be able to register to vote at both your home and term-time addresses, but you will only have one vote during a general election. If your home and term-time addresses are in two different local authority areas, for a general election, you will need to choose which address to vote from. Will I need photo ID to vote? Yes, photo identification is required to be able to vote in person in several elections, including general elections and local elections in England. There are various different forms of acceptable photo ID that you could use, including passports and driving licences. One ID option is the CitizenCard, which is a form of PASS (Proof of Age Standards Scheme) card, supported by the National Union for Students (NUS). More information about getting this card for free can be found on the NUS website. If you don't have any other kind of accepted photo ID, you can apply for a Voter Authority Certificate. The deadline to apply for a Voter Authority Certificate to vote in the 2024 general election was 17.00 on Wednesday 26 June.

Skip to main content Skip to footer Skip to main content Skip to footer Toggle navigation Student Services Online Search Type to search Student Services Online Sign in Home KA-02083 Print What do I need to know about measles? You may have heard there has been an increase in cases of measles in London and the UK. The best way to protect yourself and prevent the spread of measles is to have two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. Check the NHS website for more information. Preventing the spread of germs We all need to play a part in looking after ourselves and being considerate of others, to maintain a healthy campus to work and study. Like other infectious diseases, you can catch measles through close contact with someone who has the infection. To help prevent the spread of germs, remember to: Follow basic hygiene rules such as frequent hand washing.Keep shared facilities clean.Use tissues when you cough or sneeze and throw used tissues in the bin.Stay at home if you feel unwell and take the appropriate time to rest and recover. What are the symptoms of measles? Measles usually starts with cold-like symptoms accompanied by a fever, sore red eyes and a red-brown blotchy rash. You may also get small spots in your mouth. Check the NHS website for more information about\u00a0measles symptoms.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b I think I have measles, or I have been diagnosed with measles, what should I do? If you think you may have measles, you should: Call NHS 111, get help from 111 online, or call your GP for advice and stay away from others. Do not visit your GP surgery or health centre without calling ahead as they may suggest a remote consultation to avoid spreading infection. If you live in a King\u2019s residence, email the Residences Team so they can support you. If you have been diagnosed with measles: Take time to rest and recover.Follow the advice of your GP or health centre about how long you will need to stay away from others, this is usually for at least four days after the rash has appeared.Staff should let their line manager know. Students should let their Personal Tutor or supervisor know, so they can support with any impact on their studies. Students can also submit a mitigating circumstances request if any of their assessed work is affected.If you are in a university residence, please email the Residences Team so they can support you. What should I do if I\u2019ve been in contact with someone who has measles? If you\u2019ve been fully vaccinated or already had measles, you can carry on as normal and come to campus.If you haven\u2019t been fully vaccinated and have been in close contact with someone who has measles: Call NHS 111, get help from 111 online, or call your GP for advice. Do not visit your GP surgery or health centre without calling ahead.If you are advised by your GP to avoid close contact with others, contact your\u00a0personal tutor or supervisor to discuss your circumstances and, if you feel well enough, if it\u2019s possible to continue to study from home. If it\u2019s not possible, you may need to take the time off as sickness absence. Should I have the MMR vaccine?\u200b\u200b\u200b The UK Government advises anyone who has not had two doses of the MMR vaccine should ask their GP surgery or health centre for a vaccination appointment. You can also ask your GP to vaccinate you if you are unsure whether or not you've had these infections or the vaccinations to protect against them. Read the UK Government's MMR for all: general guidance for more information on who should have the vaccine. Is the MMR vaccine free? You can get two doses of the MMR vaccine for free on the NHS.International students and members of staff who have paid the surcharge to access NHS services are most likely eligible for the two full doses of the MMR vaccine. If you haven\u2019t had an MMR vaccine or you\u2019re unsure, please contact your GP surgery or health centre for advice.

In this article: Starting your studiesTaking a break in your studiesFinishing your studies Starting your studies Am I eligible for Council Tax Exemption when progressing from undergraduate to postgraduate study? If you complete an undergraduate degree in the summer, and then go on to start a new postgraduate course in the September of that same year, it can feel like you are simply continuing as a student, especially if your undergraduate course and postgraduate course are both at King\u2019s. However, these are regarded as two separate courses, and your student status is according to your course dates. This means that you will be considered a student up to the official course end date of your undergraduate course. You will then next be eligible when your new course starts \u2013 once you\u2019ve completed your enrolment and from the official start date of your next course, as long as you meet the eligibility criteria for Council Tax Exemption. I\u2019ve completed the online enrolment task and am starting my course very soon. When can I get my Confirmation of Study letter for banking and accommodation? You can access your Confirmation of Study letter as soon as your record has updated and shows you as \u2018current\u2019 and fully enrolled. It can take a bit of time for our systems to update and reflect your new status, so we recommend allowing up to 48 hours between completing your enrolment and your letter being available for download.If you\u2019re struggling to access your Confirmation of Study letter, please read our troubleshooting guidance I\u2019m having technical difficulties accessing this letter.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Taking a break in your studies What is the difference between being on a \u2018Dormant\u2019 status or a \u2018Dormant \u2013 Resit\u2019 status? If you are told you are on a \u2018dormant\u2019 status it means you have interrupted your studies and have taken a break in your course. You could be on \u2018Dormant\u2019 or a \u2018Dormant \u2013 Resit\u2019 status; both mean interrupted, but on \u2018resit\u2019 it means you\u2019re resitting or resubmitting an assessment.In both instances, you would not be expected to attend any classes. What emails/notifications should I expect to receive about my interruption? When you interrupt, you\u2019ll receive a confirmation email.If you haven\u2019t passed assessments to progress on your course, you\u2019ll be contacted by email to your KCL email account and advised about the options available to you, such as resitting or resubmitting. If you choose this option your status on record will changed from \u2018Current\u2019 to \u2018Dormant \u2013 Resit\u2019, and you\u2019ll receive an email confirming this.After this, if you\u2019ve passed enough to progress, you will be contacted at the end of the year and invited to re-enrol for the next year of study.If you\u2019ve decided to interrupt your studies for a different reason, you will receive an email confirming the interruption. Your interruption may be for a semester or a full year; once you\u2019re due to return, you will receive an email asking you to re-enrol.Important to know: Correspondence will come to your KCL email account so we advise keeping an eye on your inbox and checking it regularly. If I\u2019m interrupted, do I still have a personal tutor and can I contact them? Yes; whether you\u2019re interrupted while resitting or simply interrupted, you still have a personal tutor assigned to you, and you can still contact them for support related to your studies. To check who this is, see Who is my personal tutor? Can I still contact academic staff in my department? Yes, if you need support with your studies, you may approach appropriate academic staff members; this may especially helpful for you if you are resitting. What happens with my student funding while I\u2019m interrupted? For details on what happens with your funding, please read: How will interrupting impact my fees and funding?\u200b Am I entitled to Disabled Students Allowance (DSA)? Unfortunately if you\u2019re on a break you\u2019re not eligible for DSA, however we do advise getting in touch the Disability Support Team; find out more in our article Funding support for disabled students. Am I still entitled to student discounts? Some discounts will be affected; for example, the university updates Transport for London (TfL) on interruptions at regular points throughout the year and this will prompt TfL to cancel your Student Oyster card. When you return to the course, you will have to reapply to TfL for this travel discount.For other discounts from organisations such as Totum or railcard discounts, please check the organisation\u2019s website for their eligibility details.

If I\u2019m on a Tier 4 or Student visa, can I remain in the UK? For information about how interruption affects your visa status and what you\u2019re allowed to do, we advise reading Specific information for Tier 4 or Student Visa students and getting in touch with the International & Visa Advice team for guidance. Am I allowed into campus buildings? If you have a working and valid student ID card, you will be able to access campus buildings. If your ID card is not working, it could be for a number of reasons, including expiry or a card can be temporarily marked \u2018inactive\u2019 due to lack of use.If this happens, please refer to the guidance in our article\u00a0I need a replacement student ID card. Can I still access my Confirmation of Study letter while I'm interrupted? When you\u2019re fully enrolled on your course, you will be able to access and download your Confirmation of Study letter from your student record. However, if you\u2019re on a break or resitting, your status on your record will change and this will stop the automatic download of this letter. We can still produce this letter for you manually, however we will need details of why you need it. For more details please see I need to prove my student status. What support, systems and software can I still get access to? IT access: Your access should remain, including to your KCL email account. We recommend checking in on your account for any important updates that might affect you. If you\u2019re unable to access your email account it may be that your password has expired. If this happens, refer to Accessing your IT account at King'sKEATS: You\u2019ll still have access, but any modules will be removed from your record, so it\u2019s likely you won\u2019t see anything there.Libraries & Collections: Your access may vary depending on your exact circumstances, so it may be worth checking with Libraries. If your student account is still working and you have a valid student ID card, you should be able to get access to Libraries & Collections.If you\u2019re unsure or find you can\u2019t access something you\u2019re looking for, you\u2019re best to contact the Library team and they can check if there are any blocks on your library account.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bStudent Services: You can always get support from Student Services by accessing any article on Student Services Online or by logging a case with the Student Services Frontline team. Finishing your studies Am I still considered a student until my graduation ceremony? Your graduation ceremony is an occasion to mark and celebrate your achievements and the end of your studies. However, \u2018to graduate\u2019 means finishing university and getting awarded your degree. This means that you graduate when your course has officially ended \u2013 your official end date will appear on your student ID card, Confirmation of Study letter and other documentation such as your HEAR.For most students, there can be a couple of weeks or even a few months between their official course end date and ceremony date; during this time we consider you completed and graduated. Are there any exceptions? The only exception would be if you are in the process of getting an extension or resitting; this may mean your expected course end date is pushed to a later date. It can take a few days for this process to take place and for your record to be updated to reflect this. But once it is, it will appear on any letters we produce, and we recommend replacing your student ID card to show the new expected end date. Important to know: When you officially finish your course you are no longer considered a student, which means you will also stop being eligible for student discounts \u2013 this includes Council Tax Exemption. For more information about this, please refer to Who is exempt from paying Council Tax?Finishing university can be both an exciting and challenging time, and there is still support available to you as a graduate and alumni of King\u2019s. We recommend reading our articles in our Graduation category which addresses the key topics relevant to you when finishing university. In particular, we recommend these articles: Staying connected after graduationWhat support services do I have access to as a graduate?I need to prove I\u2019ve graduatedBanking and finance after graduating Am I still considered a student until my results and award are released? How quickly you receive all your ratified results and your degree award, depends on when the relevant Assessment Sub Board for your faculty meets to finalise this. This means different faculties/departments across the university may release results at slightly different times.However, you are considered a student until the official end date of your course; for most undergraduate students this will be May or June, for most postgraduate taught students this will be the end of September, and for postgraduate research students this will vary. In all cases, your official course end date will be stated on your student record and will be stated on your student ID card and on any letters we issue. Are there any exceptions? The only exception would be if you are in the process of getting an extension or resitting; this may mean your expected course end date is pushed to a later date. It can take a few days for this process to take place and for your record to be updated to reflect this. But once it is, it will appear on any letters we produce, and we recommend replacing your student ID card to show the new expected end date.

For more information about this, please refer to Who is exempt from paying Council Tax?I\u2019m waiting for my assessment results; where can I find out more?If you would like to find out more about when and how to expect details of your results, we recommend reading\u00a0When will my exam results be available? If you think you may need to apply to resit or for an extension: What are mitigating circumstances? If you have completed all your exams and submitted all required coursework, but haven\u2019t yet received your results and need to prove your status during this \u2018in-between\u2019 period, we recommend referring to these articles: I need to prove I\u2019ve finished my course and am awaiting resultsI need to prove I am highly likely to succeed on my course I have submitted my thesis and now I can\u2019t access my Confirmation of Study letter; does this mean I am no longer considered a student? As with all students, you\u2019re considered a student until the expected course end date on your student record. If you\u2019re a research student and have submitted your thesis, your record will update your enrolment status code, and this can stop the automatic letter from working. We can check your record and find out why you can\u2019t access your letter. We can produce a letter for you manually, just make sure you let us know why you need it when logging a case.
